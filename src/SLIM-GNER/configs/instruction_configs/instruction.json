"Analyze the provided sentence identifying the named entities within it. Label each entity with its correct type by enclosing it in the appropriate tags. For a generic type, the opening and closing tags are [TYPE] and [/TYPE], respectively.\nThe output should be the original sentence with the detected entities enclosed in their appropriate tags, formatted as follows: [TYPE_1] entity [/TYPE_1] ... [TYPE2] entity [/TYPE2]\nEach named entity (whether single-word or multi-word) must be enclosed in the corresponding pair of tags.\nEnsure that each opening tag has a matching closing tag.\nOnly entities should be labeled, and the rest of the sentence should remain unchanged."
