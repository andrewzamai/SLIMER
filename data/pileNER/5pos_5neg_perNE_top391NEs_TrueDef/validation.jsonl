Over the past 50 years, a variety of techniques have been developed that have in common the insufflation of gas into the central airway to facilitate carbon dioxide (CO2) clearance. These include continuous insufflation of oxygen, transtracheal jet ventilation, high frequency jet ventilation, transtracheal oxygen administration, intratracheal pulmonary ventilation, and tracheal gas insufflation (TGI). Continuous insufflation of oxygen is a technique used to enhance CO2 removal in the presence of apnea. Transtracheal jet ventilation and high frequency jet ventilation promote bulk gas flow into the lungs. Some techniques, such as transtracheal oxygen administration, provide insufflation of oxygen as an adjunct to spontaneous ventilation. However, other techniques, such as TGI, are used as an adjunct to positive pressure ventilation. Intratracheal pulmonary ventilation provides positive pressure ventilation while bypassing the upper airway. Although some of these techniques are promising adjuncts to mechanical ventilation and may help reduce ventilator-associated lung injury, much remains to be learned about their role in the care of patients with acute lung injury.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type TECHNIQUE from the text chunk you have read.

ICAM-1\/LFA-1 interaction is thought to be of importance in many immune mediated cell-cell adhesion reactions. Recently, the major human rhinovirus (HRV) receptor has been identified as ICAM-1. HRV has been shown to bind specifically to ICAM-1 on transfected COS cells and to purified ICAM-1, which has been adsorbed to plastic microtiter wells. We have compared the ability of ICAM-1 expressed on the surface of human fibroblasts (FB) to function as a receptor for HRV as well as a receptor for LFA-1-bearing human T lymphocytes. We show that FB stimulation by the cytokines IFN-gamma or IL-1, both known inducers of ICAM-1 synthesis and expression in FB, induced an increase in HRV binding to treated cells, which could be inhibited by antibody to ICAM-1. In contrast, only IFN-gamma and not IL-1 treatment of FB resulted in an increased adhesion of T lymphocytes.

In experimental studies using cilazapril, the strongest inhibition of neointima formation was obtained when treatment was initiated 6 days before injury. The MERCATOR trial showed no reduction in restenosis with cilazapril given after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The purpose of this study is to determine whether previous administration of cilazapril could prevent restenosis. A total of 167 patients were randomly and prospectively assigned to the cilazapril group or the control group. In the cilazapril group, 78 patients received a 2 mg dose of cilazparil daily, starting 7 days before PTCA and continuing for 6 months. Only 128 patients (cilazapril 56, control 72) completed the study because 39 dropped out. Coronary angiograms were evaluated by the quantitative coronary angiogram (QCA) system. There were no differences between the two groups of patients with regard to baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics. QCA analysis (cilazapril 66 lesions, control 101 lesions): the loss at follow-up in minimal lumen diameter was 0.36 +\/- 0.57 mm in the cilazapril group and 0.57 +\/- 0.75 mm in the control group (P < 0.05).

This article is aimed to review updated research on end-of-life care sedation (EOLC-S) for children and aspects surrounding this issue. Prevalence of EOLC-S for children may vary across countries on account of cultural differences, in terms of settings, legal issues and perceptions about EOLC-S, which lead to variation in patient selection and management. Although home is the preferred place of death for families, research shows hospital settings and ICUs to be the most frequent places where children die. Data on how to define refractory symptoms and update research on drug selection and dosing are lacking. Nature of symptoms at end of life (EOL) is described for cancer patients, but few articles focused on nononcological conditions. Decision making at EOL is commonly discussed with families but children are less frequently involved. A thorough search of databases was conducted for articles published in the last year. We found few articles describing EOLC-S as a last resort. But how, when and by whom a symptom is defined as refractory, is not well established. Aggressive symptom management at EOL along with advanced care planning conducted by pediatric palliative care teams could diminish EOLC-S.

The present study examined the effects of perinatal (gestation\/lactation) lead exposure on adult rates of acquisition of intravenous cocaine self-administration using an automated procedure that included both Pavlovian and operant components. For Experiment 1, female rats were gavaged daily with 0 or 16 mg lead for 30 days prior to breeding with nonexposed males. Metal administration continued through pregnancy and lactation and was discontinued at weaning (postnatal day (PND) 21). Animals born to control or lead-exposed dams subsequently were tested daily as adults in a preparation where sessions included an initial 3-h autoshaping period followed by a 3-h self-administration period where 0.20 mg\/kg cocaine was delivered contingently. During autoshaping, intravenous cocaine infusions were paired with the extension and retraction of a lever, while infusions occurred during self-administration only when a lever press was executed (FR-1).

Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is a benign tumor of placental trophoblastic cells, which release human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Several case reports have described complete hydatidiform moles with false-negative urine qualitative hCG tests. These negative pregnancy tests have been attributed to the hook effect. We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly < 100,000 mIU\/mL. The most common presentation of a hydatidiform mole is vaginal bleeding. Hydatidiform mole is associated with a risk of malignant transformation and disseminated disease. In a pregnant patient, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common presentations. Molar pregnancy is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding that should be considered. A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Urine qualitative hCG was negative and serum quantitative hCG was 1,094,950 mIU\/mL.

Early invasive therapy was defined as revascularization during first hospital stay. A seven-year follow-up for the clinical endpoint of all-cause mortality could be obtained in 342 women and 440 men, respectively. Compared with men, women were significantly older and more likely to suffer from renal insufficiency. The proportion treated with clopidogrel at admission was 43.6% for women and 52.7% for men, respectively (p=0.011). Significantly fewer women underwent an early invasive therapy compared with men (27.5% vs. 35.2%; p=0.021). Age and renal insufficiency were the strongest predictors for a conservative approach in both female and male patients. After adjustment for baseline characteristics there was no significant difference in treatment between women and men (odds ratio 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.59-1.35; p=0.588).

We also purified and characterized glucokinase and \u03b1-phosphoglucomutase, which catalyze early catabolic steps of the two carbohydrates. N. meningitidis catabolizes the two carbohydrates either via the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway or the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby forming glyceraldehyde-3-P and either pyruvate or fructose-6-P, respectively. We purified and characterized several key enzymes of the two pathways. The genes required for the transformation of glucose into gluconate-6-P and its further catabolism via the ED pathway are organized in two adjacent operons. N. meningitidis also contains genes encoding proteins which exhibit similarity to the gluconate transporter (NMV_2230) and gluconate kinase (NMV_2231) of Enterobacteriaceae and Firmicutes. However, gluconate might not be the real substrate of NMV_2230 because N. meningitidis was not able to grow on gluconate as the sole carbon source.

The observance of the Feast of the Exaltation (probably from a Greek word meaning \"bringing to light\") of the Cross has been celebrated by Christians on September 14 ever since.

This problem may be overcome by employing a method which allows the simultaneous measurement of pain ratings elicited by standardized stimulation of the nasal mucosa by carbon dioxide, together with pain-related chemo-somatosensory evoked potentials (CSSEP) and vigilance. We assessed the effect of pentazocine and acetylsalicylic acid on these parameters in 14 human volunteers and related the effects to the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs measured at the same time. Pentazocine was found to reduce the pain ratings as well as the amplitudes of the pain-related evoked potentials and to increase their latencies. Vigilance (measured by EEG power spectra and performance of a tracking task) was also significantly reduced. These effects were observed during the distribution phase and the first period of the terminal elimination phase of the drug. Acetylsalicylic acid had no significant effects on pain ratings, but reduced the amplitudes of the event-related potentials when compared to placebo controls.

Thus, the case 1 of the high voltage tube tank is manufactured in such a way that the entire inner wall is usually shielded by insulators 2 or that the ends of the high voltage circuit means are wrapped by insulators to prevent discharge of high voltage. In detail, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the inner wall of the high voltage tube tank is shielded by insulators 2 and the inner space is divided by a partition 3 to maintain the fixed distance among the high voltage apparatuses. In addition, the rooms of the parted case are filled with insulating oil L to prevent discharge of high voltage generated among the storing high voltage circuit means.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type CONTAINER from the text chunk you have read.

A detergent extract isolated from the enriched fraction of integral membrane proteins of Jurkat cells showed an enhanced tyrosine phosphate level when phosphorylated in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). The enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when the reaction time exceeded 6 min; at shorter incubation times, however, TPA inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation. When the reaction proceeded for a constant time period longer than 6 min and phorbol esters were added at different times after the start of the reaction, two phases of an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 50 kDa protein were observed. An increased phosphorylation of the 50 kDa protein was correlated with an enhanced phosphorylation of poly(Glu4,Tyr1). The two phases of enhanced phosphorylation differed in their TPA and PDBu requirement and in the proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated. Studies with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors showed a negatively correlated effect on the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in phase I; tyrosine phosphorylation was further augmented. In phase II the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the efficiency of the PKC inhibitors on the alpha-isoform of PKC which was found in the cell extract.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type IMAGE from the text chunk you have read.

Moreover, such labeling machines occupy a relatively large space, because of the large table plate. FIG. 4 of the same document discloses an embodiment example, in which the labeling aggregates are designed as freestanding, exchangeable modules with their own support and an associated drive.

In comparison to the first mentioned embodiment, this solution already allows an improved handling of the labeling aggregate during aggregate replacement.

The organophosphate flame retardant, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), has been detected with increasing frequency in environmental samples and its primary metabolite is considered to be diphenyl phosphate (DPHP). Information on the adverse effects of these compounds in avian species is limited. Here, we investigate the effects of TPHP and DPHP on cytotoxicity and mRNA expression, as well as in vitro metabolism of TPHP, by use of a chicken embryonic hepatocyte (CEH) screening assay. After 36 h of exposure, CEH cytotoxicity was observed following exposure to >10 \u03bcM TPHP (LC50 = 47 \u00b1 8 \u03bcM), whereas no significant cytotoxic effects were observed for DPHP concentrations up to 1000 \u03bcM. Using a custom chicken ToxChip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, the number of genes altered by 10 \u03bcM DPHP (9 out of 27) was greater than that by 10 \u03bcM TPHP (4 out of 27). Importantly, 4 of 6 genes associated with lipid\/cholesterol metabolism were significantly dysregulated by DPHP, suggesting a potential pathway of importance for DPHP toxicity.

Hippocampal receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) turnover is severely blunted in aged rats that demonstrate cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze. To further examine the anatomical localization of this deficit, we examined the topography of muscarinic receptor-mediated PI turnover in young and aged-learning impaired rats by taking advantage of an autoradiographic method that visualizes PI turnover by measuring the diacylglycerol (DAG) branch of the PI turnover signal transduction system. Using this method, muscarinic cholinergic receptors were stimulated in hippocampal slices with agonist, and the receptor-mediated incorporation of [3H] cytidine into [3H]CDP-DAG was subsequently quantified in subregions of the hippocampus using film autoradiography. Our results show a significant decrease in basal incorporation of [ 3H]CDP-DAG in the subiculum and in the dentate gyrus in the aged rats. The muscarinic receptor-mediated [3H]CDP-DAG response was significantly blunted in the aged rats in subiculum, CA3, and CA1. In contrast, the receptor-mediated response was maintained in the dentate gyrus and hilus. These results indicate that the age-associated impairment in receptor-mediated PI turnover differs regionally, with a reduction in the subiculum and hippocampus proper that is pronounced relative to the hilus and dentate gyrus.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ORGANISM from the text chunk you have read.

Many engine control algorithms, including fuel control algorithms and diagnostic algorithms, require a reasonably accurate assessment of the engine soak time to achieve optimal and reliable operation. While it is possible to simply measure the time since the last electrical power-down or key-off event, such information is insufficient for many purposes, and may actually misrepresent the engine soak time if one or more short engine cycles occur. Accordingly, many algorithms infer soak time by measuring changes in the engine coolant or ambient temperatures, even though such information is only indirectly related to soak time. See for example, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,546 to Rumpsa et al., which defines soak time as the time between when the engine is turned off and then restarted. Instead of measuring the soak time with a timer, Rumpsa et al. infer the soak time based on measured engine and air temperatures at engine turn-off and at engine re-starting.

Description of the Related Art\nIn order to achieve next-generation mobile and multimedia communications, ultra-fast transmission of a large amount of data is necessary. The millimeter-wave band having a large bandwidth can satisfy this requirement. In addition, in a field other than communications, shock-absorbing vehicle radar as a new form to take advantage of characteristics of the millimeter-wave band has been introduced. It is greatly anticipated that the millimeter-wave radar can ensure safety in fog or snow. Conventional laser radar using light lacks this capability. When a conventional circuit structure composed almost exclusively of microstrip lines is used in a millimeter-wave band, loss increases due to reduction of Q. Furthermore, in a conventional type of widely used TE01xcex4 dielectric resonator, a large amount of resonant energy leaks out of the resonator. As a result, in the millimeter-wave band in which relative dimensions of a resonator and a circuit are small, undesirable coupling with the lines occurs, thereby creating difficulties in design and characteristic reproduction. In order to solve these problems, a millimeter-wave band module using PDIC(trademark) (Planer Dielectric Integrated Circuit) technology is mentioned.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type WEATHER from the text chunk you have read.

In past Covenant & Conversation essays on Acharei Mot, we have looked at the scapegoat as it figures in Jewish tradition and, in a very different way, in other cultures. But there are other dimensions of the rite that cry out for explanation. We argued that there were two goats because Yom Kippur represents a dual process of kappara, atonement, and tahara, purification, directed respectively at guilt and shame. But this does not explain why the two animals were required to be as similar as possible to one another, nor does it account for the role of casting lots (goralot).

Long-term changes in pharyngeal airway morphology were evaluated after mandibular setback surgery in 10 women who were diagnosed as having skeletal mandibular prognathism and underwent mandibular setback surgery by bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) and orthodontic multi-bracket treatment. The subjects were assessed before treatment (T1), 3-6 months after SSRO (T2), and 2 or more years after SSRO (T3). From T1 to T2, the pharyngeal airway constricted significantly. On the other hand, from T2 to T3, the lower facial morphology showed no significant changes. The pharyngeal airway morphology showed significant changes in soft-palate length and posterior reference line to point of posterior tongue, indicating a tendency for relapse. These results suggest that, although the lower facial morphology and the pharyngeal airway morphology showed marked changes after SSRO, the pharyngeal airway morphology exhibited gradual physiologic readaptation. However, because the lower facial morphology after surgery was retained and stable for a long period, it was considered normal for the pharyngeal airway morphology to adapt after surgery to the improved hard tissue relationship.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ANATOMY from the text chunk you have read.

Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a critical component of the metastatic cascade, is also found at high concentrations in ovarian ascites and ovarian cancers, and the levels of uPA correlate inversely with prognosis. Because LPA stimulates the invasion of both hepatoma and lung cell lines, we investigated whether LPA could induce uPA secretion by ovarian epithelial cells and whether this process was associated with malignant transformation of ovarian epithelial cells. As indicated by zymography and Western blotting, physiologically relevant concentrations of LPA equivalent to those present in ovarian cancer ascites stimulated uPA secretion in the ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR-3, SKOV-3, OVCA 429, OVCA 432, and OVCA 433, but not from established normal ovarian epithelial (NOE) cells as indicated by normal epithelial cell lines NOE 033 and NOE 035 or from SV40 large T antigen-immortalized normal epithelial cell lines IOSE 29 and IOSE 80. 18:1 LPA, but not 18:0 LPA, 16:0 LPA, or lysophosphatidylcholine, induced uPA secretion, concordant with previous studies of LPA receptor selectivity.

Description of the Related Art\nIn order to achieve next-generation mobile and multimedia communications, ultra-fast transmission of a large amount of data is necessary. The millimeter-wave band having a large bandwidth can satisfy this requirement. In addition, in a field other than communications, shock-absorbing vehicle radar as a new form to take advantage of characteristics of the millimeter-wave band has been introduced. It is greatly anticipated that the millimeter-wave radar can ensure safety in fog or snow. Conventional laser radar using light lacks this capability. When a conventional circuit structure composed almost exclusively of microstrip lines is used in a millimeter-wave band, loss increases due to reduction of Q. Furthermore, in a conventional type of widely used TE01xcex4 dielectric resonator, a large amount of resonant energy leaks out of the resonator. As a result, in the millimeter-wave band in which relative dimensions of a resonator and a circuit are small, undesirable coupling with the lines occurs, thereby creating difficulties in design and characteristic reproduction. In order to solve these problems, a millimeter-wave band module using PDIC(trademark) (Planer Dielectric Integrated Circuit) technology is mentioned.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type STRUCTURE from the text chunk you have read.

The public veneration of the Cross of Christ originated in the fourth century, according to early accounts, beginning with the miraculous discovery of the cross on September 14, 326, by Saint Helen, mother of Constantine, while she was on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem -- the same day that two churches built at the site of Calvary by Constantine were dedicated. The observance of the Feast of the Exaltation (probably from a Greek word meaning \"bringing to light\") of the Cross has been celebrated by Christians on September 14 ever since. In the Western Church, the feast came into prominence in the seventh century, apparently inspired by the recovery of a portion of the Cross, said to have been taken from Jerusalem the Persians, by the Roman emperor Heraclius in 629. Christians \"exalt\" the Cross of Christ as the instrument of our salvation. Adoration of the Cross is, thus, adoration of Jesus Christ, the God Man, who suffered and died on this Roman instrument of torture for our redemption from sin and death. The cross represents the One Sacrifice by which Jesus, obedient even unto death, accomplished our salvation.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type SPORT from the text chunk you have read.

The usual assumption of a Poisson model for the number of chromosome aberrations in controlled calibration experiments implies variance equal to the mean. However, it is known that chromosome aberration data from experiments involving high linear energy transfer radiations can be overdispersed, i.e. the variance is greater than the mean. Present methods for dealing with overdispersed chromosome data rely on frequentist statistical techniques. In this paper. the problem of overdispersion is considered from a Bayesian standpoint. The Bayes Factor is used to compare Poisson and negative binomial models for two previously published calibration data sets describing the induction of dicentric chromosome aberrations by high doses of neutrons. Posterior densities for the model parameters, which characterise dose response and overdispersion are calculated and graphed. Calibrative densities are derived for unknown neutron doses from hypothetical radiation accident data to deterimine the impact of different model assumptions on dose estimates. The main conclusion is that an initial assumption of a negative binomial model is the conservative approach to chromosome dosimetry for high LET radiations.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type STORE from the text chunk you have read.

The progression of endometrial growth to the appearance of the triple layer, endometrial thickness, and echogenicity was compared between protocols. At least one high quality blastocyst was transferred in a double embryo transfer. The time of the appearance of the endometrial triple layer was statistically significant for the pregnancy rate only in the GnRH antagonist protocol. The endometrial thickness on the day of the appearance of the triple layer had a statistically significant influence on the pregnancy rate in the GnRH antagonist and in the long GnRH agonist protocols. The highest pregnancy rate for the long GnRH agonist and the GnRH antagonist protocols was observed when the endometrium thickness was 12-13 mm (61.6% and 58.8%, respectively).

For this reason they are attractive targets of immunotherapy regimes which aim to either attenuate the T cell responses to prevent allergic reactions, rejection of transplanted tissue and autoimmune disease, or augment responses against poorly immunogenic tumor or viral antigens. CD28 and ICOS provide costimulatory signals that allow a T cell to secrete effector cytokines but only CD28 costimulation protects a cell from apoptosis and permits long-term expansion. While much is known about the effects of the CD28 family on T cell activation, considerably less is understood about the signaling pathways that control these diverse functional outcomes. For instance, several groups have observed that CD28 costimulation enhances the expression of Bcl-xL and IL-2 using distinct mechanisms but the pathways that lead to this distinct regulation are unknown. Our approach is to utilize the structural similarity of the CD28 family to create a series of loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) mutant that will allow us to probe the mechanisms by which CD28 and ICOS alter T cell activation in primary human T cells.

An impingement oven is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,679,542 to Don Paul Smith. These ovens, which are a special type of forced convection oven using columnated heated air to impact the pizza, have increased heat transfer capabilities and therefore have reduced the bake time of pizza and other foods significantly. Impingement ovens have achieved wide acceptance among pizza restaurants, and pizza delivery systems, especially those which deal with high volume and fast service. The typical bake time for the commercially available impingement ovens is in the range of about 5 to 9 minutes.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type PATENT from the text chunk you have read.

In the past, surgery designed to heal wounds or reduce the risk for development of wounds in people with diabetes has been haphazard. A recently published pilot study in Gait & Posture suggests strongly that we can work toward predicting success preoperatively.1 See http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yzbkt96\n\nAlthough the patient with diabetes and renal failure presents serious challenges to the limb salvage team, there is evidence and argument to support aggressive treatment and attempted limb salvage in a multidisciplinary clinical environment. An abundance of medical literature discusses the separate wound care challenges posed by diabetes and renal failure. Less work has been done, however, to identify proper treatment and salvage techniques for patients who suffer from both maladies. For patients with diabetes and rigid forefoot deformities, traditional surgical procedures and prolonged offloading periods have a high risk of potential complications. Accordingly, these authors offer perspectives and step-by-step pearls on the use of percutaneous surgery and minimal incision surgery procedures. I read with interest the recent article on diabetic limb salvage (\u201cHow To Form A Diabetic Limb Salvage Team\u201d in the June 2010 issue). Over the last 14 years, I have been significantly involved with wound care and limb salvage in the diabetic patient population.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ISSUE from the text chunk you have read.

Recent research suggests that adolescent dieting may not be benign and that it is becoming more frequent in younger age groups. The present study investigated dieting motivation and the underlying attitudes to body weight and shape in two age groups. Eighty-four nine-year-old and 86 14-year-old girls from the same school completed assessments of dietary restraint, body esteem, body satisfaction and body figure preferences. The girls' body weight and height were also measured. The distribution of restraint scores revealed individuals from both age groups in every category of dieting motivation. Subjects in the upper and lower quartiles of the restraint distribution were identified and compared on the other measures. The highly restrained girls expressed low body esteem and discontent with their body build, weight and certain regions of their bodies. Furthermore, their 'ideal' body shape was significantly slimmer than their perceived current body shape, and slimmer even than that of the non-dieters. This pattern held for both the nine- and 14-year-olds, of whom half of each age group were of average or below average weight index for their age. The appearance of these dispositions and behaviours by the age of nine, or possibly earlier, may result in a marked increase in future clinical eating problems and disorders.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type CODE from the text chunk you have read.

The organophosphate flame retardant, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), has been detected with increasing frequency in environmental samples and its primary metabolite is considered to be diphenyl phosphate (DPHP). Information on the adverse effects of these compounds in avian species is limited. Here, we investigate the effects of TPHP and DPHP on cytotoxicity and mRNA expression, as well as in vitro metabolism of TPHP, by use of a chicken embryonic hepatocyte (CEH) screening assay. After 36 h of exposure, CEH cytotoxicity was observed following exposure to >10 \u03bcM TPHP (LC50 = 47 \u00b1 8 \u03bcM), whereas no significant cytotoxic effects were observed for DPHP concentrations up to 1000 \u03bcM. Using a custom chicken ToxChip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, the number of genes altered by 10 \u03bcM DPHP (9 out of 27) was greater than that by 10 \u03bcM TPHP (4 out of 27). Importantly, 4 of 6 genes associated with lipid\/cholesterol metabolism were significantly dysregulated by DPHP, suggesting a potential pathway of importance for DPHP toxicity. Rapid degradation of TPHP was observed in CEH exposed to 10 \u03bcM, but the resulting concentration of DPHP accounted for only 17% of the initial TPHP dosing concentration.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type CELL TYPE from the text chunk you have read.

Gly m Bd 28K, a soybean allergen, was a glycoprotein with glycan moieties, which are supposed to be the Man(3)GlcNAc(2) backbone with the beta1-->2 xylose and alpha1-->3 fucose branches. The purpose of the present study was to examine the IgE-binding ability of the glycan moiety of Gly m Bd 28K in the binding reaction with patients' sera. A peptide containing the glycan moiety was prepared from Gly m Bd 28K by digestion with lysyl endopeptidase. The binding site of the glycan moiety was determined by amino acid sequence analyses. The glycan moiety of the allergen was characterized using anti-horseradish peroxidase antibody (anti-HRP) recognizing the N-linked glycan moieties of glycoproteins. The binding of patients' IgE antibodies with their glycan moiety was examined by an immunostaining technique using the glycopeptide and its deglycosylated peptide derived from Gly m Bd 28K. The binding site of the glycan moiety in Gly m Bd 28K was shown to be its Asn20 residue. Gly m Bd 28K did react with anti-HRP and the sera of soybean-sensitive patients, but the binding of IgE antibodies was inhibited by the preincubation with anti-HRP.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type PATIENT from the text chunk you have read.

However, it is not known if these in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells have the capacity to migrate in vivo, especially to T cell areas of lymphoid tissue. We have used a fluorescent marker system to track the migration of dendritic cells, propagated in vitro from chimpanzee peripheral blood, following SC injection. We report that injected dendritic cells migrate spontaneously and rapidly to draining lymph nodes where they remain for at least five days. The injected cells interdigitate with T cells in the parafollicular and paracortical zones and retain high level expression of CD86, CD40 and MHC Class II molecules, reflecting a phenotype of potent APC. We conclude that dendritic cells differentiated in vitro from peripheral blo od and administered subcutaneously behave in a manner very similar to endogenous Langerhans cells. These data provide strong experimental support, in a highly relevant large animal model, for the use of in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells as vehicles for immunotherapy. More importantly, they show that the SC route of injection delivers these antigen-presenting cells to sites of T cell activation, a prerequisite for the generation of an effective immune response.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type APPLICATION from the text chunk you have read.

The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are potent mitogens with both endocrine and autocrine-paracrine effects on cell growth. The IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) are found in many human biological fluids and in the conditioned media of many cell cultures. These molecules are ontogenically and hormonally regulated. Nevertheless, the biological role(s) of the IGFBPs remain controversial. Both inhibitory and stimulatory effects of IGFBPs on cell growth have been suggested. In order to evaluate the actions that endogenously produced IGFBPs have on cell growth, we constructed a mammalian expression vector containing the human IGFBP-3 cDNA and transfected the murine Balb\/c cell line. While plasmid-transfected control Balb\/c cells (Tx-P) produced only small amounts of a 28-kilodalton IGFBP, the IGFBP-3-transfected Balb\/c cells (Tx-BP-3) additionally expressed readily detectable amounts of the characteristic 40- to 44-kilodalton human IGFBP-3 protein doublet and its mRNA. Growth of Tx-BP-3 in serum-containing media was significantly (2.5-fold) slower compared with Tx-P grown under identical conditions. Fully confluent Tx-BP-3 cells arrested their growth at a cell density that was 3-fold lower than did Tx-P cells.

In the operative treatment of a long bone fracture, the most important point is to secure the bone healing and to strengthen the bone after removal of internal fixation materials. In this regards, the author has analyzed the mechanical strength of various internal fixation methods (a plate, a medullary nail, screws and encircling wires) on the bone by using acrylics models. Experimental studies of their influences on the bone have also been performed especially investigating the decrease in the bone strength in rabbits. All of internal fixation materials are made of 316L stainless steel. Recently, there has been a tendency to use larger materials for internal fixations such as an AO compression plate or a K\u00fcntscher type medullary nail. However, it was found that the rigid plate fixation greatly affects the bone strength. A medullary nail produced less impairment to the bone. But this method is restricted in its application because of the weak fixability of the torsional load. On the other hand, the internal fixations with screws or encircling wires are weaker than the other methods especially against the bending load. Therefore the commencement of postoperative treatment will be delayed.

However, due to the lagtime in standard biochemical assays and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, clinicians have come to depend on broad-spectrum, empirical treatment which contributes to both drug resistance and patient death. The goal of this project is to develop a breath test for rapid pathogen identification and treatment monitoring in ARI to facilitate more immediate, targeted treatment in the clinic. The current proposal is focused on bacterial pathogen identification with future goals to expand to viral and fungal pathogens. Substrate cleavage assays are currently used to query bacterial protease activity and can be used to rapidly and accurately classify bacteria down to the species level. Leveraging the protease-responsive nanosensor platform in the Bhatia lab, the goal of this proposal is to develop inhalable multiplexed nanosensors that release volatile reporters into the breath in response to infection- associated proteases in the lung. From there, we can generate breath ?fingerprints? for pathogens common in ARIs such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae).

This study compares two methods of selecting inspiratory time (Ti) during mechanical ventilation. One selects a standard Ti producing a brief inspiratory pressure plateau (P). The other uses simultaneous pressure, flow and tidal volume (VT) waveforms, generated by a computer-assisted lung mechanics analyzer, to reduce Ti to the point where Vt ceases to accumulate and flow returns to zero. This method does not produce a pressure plateau (NP). Following saline lung washout, ten intubated, paralyzed surfactant-depleted cats were ventilated with pressure-preset infant ventilators at constant measured VT and rates. Five animals were initially ventilated with P (Ti = 0.98 +\/- 0.02 s) and five with NP (Ti = 0.77 +\/- 0.10 s). Ti was then varied to produce P or NP by using a four-period crossover design. All other ventilator variables remained constant. Intravascular pressures, thermodilution cardiac outputs, arterial and mixed venous blood gases and oxygen saturations, airway pressures, Ti, VT, and gas flows were measured; respiratory system mechanics, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients, and intrapulmonary shunts were determined for each study period.

Wide bandgap semiconductors are promising materials for the development of polariton-based optoelectronic devices operating at room temperature (RT).

The impact of scattering states of excitons on polariton dispersion is investigated. Only the lower polariton branches (LPBs) can be clearly observed in ZnO MCs since the large vacuum Rabi splitting pushes the upper polariton branches (UPBs) into the scattering absorption states in the ZnO bulk active region. In addition, we systematically investigate the polariton relaxation bottleneck in bulk ZnO-based MCs. Angle-resolved photoluminescence measurements are performed from 100 to 300 K for different cavity-exciton detunings. A clear polariton relaxation bottleneck is observed at low temperature and large negative cavity detuning conditions.

Based on the viewing and analysis of approximately two dozen films, I have determined that Western filmmakers working between 193 9 and 2010 have chosen to depict Russian men and women in decidedly different ways. Representations of male Russian characters shifted significantly based on the state of foreign relations. In contrast, female Russian film characters changed little over time. In the interest of producing profitable entertainment, filmmakers developed this formula prior to the start of the Cold War and have continued to employ it. This gender dichotomy is representative of a melding of the belief in the superiority of Western society and patriarchal attitudes. This study documents the changes in depictions of Russian men while also describing the static portrayal of Russian women. Filmmakers are likely to adhere to their current methods of developing Russian characters as long as the films they make continue to be profitable.

An impingement oven is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,679,542 to Don Paul Smith. These ovens, which are a special type of forced convection oven using columnated heated air to impact the pizza, have increased heat transfer capabilities and therefore have reduced the bake time of pizza and other foods significantly.

Many engine control algorithms, including fuel control algorithms and diagnostic algorithms, require a reasonably accurate assessment of the engine soak time to achieve optimal and reliable operation. While it is possible to simply measure the time since the last electrical power-down or key-off event, such information is insufficient for many purposes, and may actually misrepresent the engine soak time if one or more short engine cycles occur. Accordingly, many algorithms infer soak time by measuring changes in the engine coolant or ambient temperatures, even though such information is only indirectly related to soak time. See for example, the U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,546 to Rumpsa et al., which defines soak time as the time between when the engine is turned off and then restarted.

Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is a benign tumor of placental trophoblastic cells, which release human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Several case reports have described complete hydatidiform moles with false-negative urine qualitative hCG tests. These negative pregnancy tests have been attributed to the hook effect. We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly < 100,000 mIU\/mL. The most common presentation of a hydatidiform mole is vaginal bleeding. Hydatidiform mole is associated with a risk of malignant transformation and disseminated disease. In a pregnant patient, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common presentations. Molar pregnancy is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding that should be considered.

Age-dependent variation in etiologic agents of meningitis markedly influences selection of therapeutic regimens.

Experimental studies of their influences on the bone have also been performed especially investigating the decrease in the bone strength in rabbits. All of internal fixation materials are made of 316L stainless steel. Recently, there has been a tendency to use larger materials for internal fixations such as an AO compression plate or a K\u00fcntscher type medullary nail. However, it was found that the rigid plate fixation greatly affects the bone strength. A medullary nail produced less impairment to the bone. But this method is restricted in its application because of the weak fixability of the torsional load. On the other hand, the internal fixations with screws or encircling wires are weaker than the other methods especially against the bending load. Therefore the commencement of postoperative treatment will be delayed.

The authors searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases (January 1, 1990 to September 24, 2014) for any randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials comparing silicone gel sheeting or silicone gel with a control group for prevention of hypertrophic scars or keloids. All collected trials were assessed for methodological quality, control group and treatment group, and number of participants developing hypertrophic scars and keloids. The authors calculated risk ratios (RR) from each trial for the development of abnormal scarring and combined these using random-effects model meta-analysis. Between-study heterogeneity was calculated by using the I2 statistic. Ten trials in 9 studies were pooled (random effect; I\u00b2 = 88%).","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type TREATMENT from the text chunk you have read.

The battle was fought north and east of the city of Zadar, Croatia, in the second half of September and early October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence.

The JNA's advance was supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and Navy. Fighting stopped on 5 October, when a cease-fire agreement was reached by the belligerents after the JNA reached the outskirts of Zadar and blocked all land routes to the city.

Invariant NK T (iNKT) cells are a distinct subset of T cells that rapidly produce an array of immunoregulatory cytokines upon activation. Cytokines produced by iNKT cells subsequently transactivate other leukocytes and elicit their respective effector functions. In this way, iNKT cells play a central role in coordinating the development of immune responses in a variety of settings. However, the mechanisms governing the quality of the iNKT cell response elicited remain poorly defined. To address whether changes in the CD1d expression pattern could regulate iNKT cell function, we generated a transgenic (Tg) mouse model in which thymocytes and peripheral T cells express high levels of CD1d (Lck-CD1d Tg+ mice). The expression of CD1d by T cells was sufficient to rescue development of iNKT cells in mice deficient of endogenous CD1d. However, the relative proportions of iNKT cell subsets in Lck-CD1d Tg+ mice were distinctly different from those in wild-type mice, suggesting an altered developmental program. Additionally, iNKT cells were hyporesponsive to antigenic stimulation in vivo. Interestingly, Lck-CD1d Tg+ mice develop liver pathology in the absence of any exogenous manipulation. The results of these studies suggest that changes to the CD1d expression program modulate iNKT cell development and function.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type MOLECULE from the text chunk you have read.

Subsequently, in the early 1990s, basing on the assumption that pregnant women attending ANC are representative of the general adult population of both males and females in the reproductive age groups, the NACP developed a protocol for ANC HIV and syphilis sero-surveillance, and expanded activities to 11 of the then 20 regions of mainland Tanzania. This protocol was implemented until 1999, when the NACP undertook a comprehensive review that resulted in improved methods for HIV and syphilis surveillance. In 1999, the NACP revised the protocol for ANC surveillance and came up with new methods of conducting sentinel surveillance that included the introduction of a 3-month data collection period to replace the previous system of continuous data collection, the introduction of a technology of using dried blood spots (DBS) filter paper cards for blood storage and the standardization of HIV test approaches and quality assurance system.

The full-length cDNA of EcIRF-1 is 1,730 bp, including an open reading frame of 906 bp, a 5'-terminal untranslated region (5'-UTR) of 153 bp, and a 3'-UTR of 671 bp. The EcIRF-1 gene consists of 10 exons and 9 introns, spanning over approximate 4.3 kb of genomic sequence. The 5'-UTR sequence contains an exon and an intron, and the 3'-UTR sequence is included in the last exon. Expression analysis by real-time PCR reveals that the EcIRF-1 gene is ubiquitously expressed in various healthy fish tissues, whereas its expression is upregulated in vivo in response to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid or lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Subcellular localization analysis shows the EcIRF-1 is an intranuclearly localized and immobile protein in the cultured fish cells. Data presented in this paper provide an important base to further understand EcIRF-1 gene function and its regulation associated with interferon immune system in orange-spotted grouper.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type GENE from the text chunk you have read.

The two armies clashed near the town of Lutterberg, Lower Saxony. The 14,000 mostly Prussian Allied troops, were overwhelmed by several charges of French cavalry and were forced to withdraw.

Following calibration of the automated analyser (Nephelometer BN 100) with a human haptoglobin standard, the measurements were performed using anti-human antiserum from rabbits. Differences in age, gender or breed of apparently healthy animals seem to have no influence on the plasma concentration of the protein. The average plasma level of haptoglobin in animals suffering from acute respiratory diseases was significantly higher. Furthermore, an increase was observed in animals without clinical symptoms living on a farm characterized by obvious defects in housing conditions. Comparison studies of the nephelometric method by use of a human or porcine standard for calibration and different anti-human or anti-porcine antisera with radial immunodiffusion as a reference method resulted in high correlation coefficients for all variations. Optimal accuracy was obtained by calibrating the analyser with a porcine standard. Haptoglobin determinations have been shown to be a useful tool for health monitoring during the integrated pig-production process, allowing recognition of performance-reducing conditions. The immunonephelometric determination method is suitable for quantifying porcine plasma haptoglobin for routine checks.

As the first amniotes were reptiles, the present review focuses on past and recent information on the evolution of reptilian epidermis and the stratum corneum. We aim to generalize the discussion on the evolution of the skin in amniotes. Corneous cell envelopes were absent in fish, and first appeared in adult amphibian epidermis. Stem reptiles evolved a multilayered stratum corneum based on a programmed cell death, intensified the production of matrix proteins (e.g., HRPs), corneous cell envelope proteins (e.g., loricrine-like, sciellin-like, and transglutaminase), and complex lipids to limit water loss. Other proteins were later produced in association to the soft or hairy epidermis in therapsids (e.g., involucrin, profilaggrin-filaggrin, trichohyalin, trichocytic keratins), or to the hard keratin of hairs, quills, horns, claws (e.g., tyrosine-rich, glycine-rich, sulphur-rich matrix proteins).

That was for the boobs. There has been no significant change in Europe, within or outside the Soviet Union, just as there is no significant change in an opera when one soprano is replaced by another. The ascent of Gorbachev to the post of general manager in the Soviet was naturally saluted with the usual fanfare about a \"mellowing of the r\u00e9gime\" etc. ad nauseam. Needless to say, that was just another performance of the farce that has been periodically staged since 1918 to convince suckers that the Communist r\u00e9gime was becoming civilized.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type QUALITY from the text chunk you have read.

It was originally built as a synagogue, running through a succession of congregations, and continues to be used as one occasionally. The building is located at 172 Norfolk Street, between Stanton Street and East Houston Street. It was erected in 1849, making it the oldest surviving synagogue building in New York City, and the fourth-oldest surviving synagogue building in the United States. It was the largest synagogue in the United States at the time of its construction, and is one of the few built in Gothic Revival style. Spanish sculptor and painter Angel Orensanz purchased the property in 1986, about after 12 years after its last synagogue-owners had abandoned its use. He restored it, and converted it into an art gallery and performance space known as the Angel Orensanz Foundation Center for the Arts.

Research suggests that increases in gross domestic product (GDP) lead to increases in traffic deaths plausibly due to the increased road traffic induced by an expanding economy. However, there also seems to exist a long-term effect of economic growth that is manifested in improved traffic safety and reduced rates of traffic deaths. Previous studies focus on either the short-term, procyclical effect, or the long-term, protective effect. The aim of the present study is to estimate the short-term and long-term effects jointly in order to assess the net impact of GDP on traffic mortality. We extracted traffic death rates for the period 1960-2011 from the WHO Mortality Database for 18 OECD countries. Data on GDP\/capita were obtained from the Maddison Project. We performed error correction modelling to estimate the short-term and long-term effects of GDP on the traffic death rates. The estimates from the error correction modelling for the entire study period suggested that a one-unit increase (US$1000) in GDP\/capita yields an instantaneous short-term increase in the traffic death rate by 0.58 (p<0.001), and a long-term decrease equal to -1.59 (p<0.001).","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY from the text chunk you have read.

To determine the mechanism by which liver alkaline phosphatase (LALP) isoenzyme is converted from a membrane-bound enzyme to the soluble enzyme during cholestasis. Serum and tissues from 2 dogs. The LALP was purified by use of affinity chromatography in samples of serum from dogs with complete bile duct obstruction. Gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry was used to detect myo-inositol residues that would be evident when serum LALP had been membrane-attached and released by phospholipase activity. Exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and octyl-sepharose phase separation of the serum isolate were used to confirm cleavage of the hydrophobic membrane anchor. Western immunoblot analysis was used to distinguish release by glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) from that by glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC). Intact hepatocytes were incubated with canine serum GPI-PLD to test sensitivity of LALP to release by GPI-PLD. Hepatocyte membrane fragments were treated with serum GPI-PLD and mixtures of taurocholate and taurodeoxycholate to test effects of bile acids on LALP release. Amounts of myo-inositol per mole of serum LALP isolate were equal to amounts detected with LALP isolated from hepatic tissue. Evaluation of results of western immunoblot analysis and electrophoretic mobility suggested release by GPI-PLD rather than by GPI-PLC.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a dielectric filter, a transmission-reception sharing unit, and a communication device for use in the microwave band and the millimeter-wave band. 2. Description of the Related Art\nIn order to achieve next-generation mobile and multimedia communications, ultra-fast transmission of a large amount of data is necessary. The millimeter-wave band having a large bandwidth can satisfy this requirement. In addition, in a field other than communications, shock-absorbing vehicle radar as a new form to take advantage of characteristics of the millimeter-wave band has been introduced. It is greatly anticipated that the millimeter-wave radar can ensure safety in fog or snow. Conventional laser radar using light lacks this capability. When a conventional circuit structure composed almost exclusively of microstrip lines is used in a millimeter-wave band, loss increases due to reduction of Q. Furthermore, in a conventional type of widely used TE01xcex4 dielectric resonator, a large amount of resonant energy leaks out of the resonator. As a result, in the millimeter-wave band in which relative dimensions of a resonator and a circuit are small, undesirable coupling with the lines occurs, thereby creating difficulties in design and characteristic reproduction. In order to solve these problems, a millimeter-wave band module using PDIC(trademark) (Planer Dielectric Integrated Circuit) technology is mentioned.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ENERGY from the text chunk you have read.

As the dual pharmacological action of partial beta 1-adrenoceptor agonists should improve left ventricular function while also protecting the myocardium against excessive sympathetic stimulation they may be useful in the treatment of heart failure. Therefore, we studied the pharmacological effects of xamoterol (Corwin, ICI 118, 587), a compound with mixed agonist and antagonistic properties at cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in electrically driven human papillary muscle strips from failing human hearts. Specimens were obtained from patients with different grades of myocardial failure who underwent mitral valve replacement (NYHA II-III) or heart transplantation (NYHA IV). Xamoterol (0.0001-100 mumol l-1) produced only negative inotropic effects, as measured by changes in isometric force of contraction in diseased human papillary muscle strips. However, isoprenaline (0.0001-10 mumol l-1) and ouabain (0.01-0.3 mumol l-1) enhanced force of contraction in the same hearts. Prestimulation with noradrenaline (3 mumol l-1) augmented the negative inotropic effect of xamoterol. It is concluded that xamoterol exerts primarily beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity in the failing human myocardium.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type COMMUNICATION from the text chunk you have read.

Additionally, cloud computing provides computation, software applications, data access and data management and storage resources without requiring cloud users to know the location and other details of the computing infrastructure. End users access cloud based applications through a web browser while the business software and data are stored on servers at a remoter location. Private cloud is infrastructure operated for an organization and can be managed internally or externally. Further, there are numerous applications running on each of the servers which require several processors and memory for executing instructions. However, due to the non-uniform use of these applications, handling sudden demand of resources (workload bursts) by the applications and managing resources within the cloud computing environment becomes critical. In the existing technologies, resources are managed by creating resources pools and specifying percentage of resources that need to be reserved for different virtual machines that belong to a resource pool.

These findings suggest that both peak and cumulative spine loads should be considered when evaluating injury risk in the nursing profession. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: This study has shown that tasks other than patient transfers and lifts are important in the assessment of low back injury risk in nurses. The method developed is a relatively straightforward approach that can be used to estimate peak and cumulative spine load to provide insight to risk of injury in many occupational settings.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type DIRECTION from the text chunk you have read.

The first aim was to investigate how cyclists orient forces applied by the feet to the pedals in response to varying power output and cadence demands, and the second was to assess whether competitive riders responded differently from recreational riders to such variations. One group consisted of US Cycling Federation category II licensed competitive cyclists (n = 7) and the second group consisted of recreational cyclists with no competitive experience (n = 38). The subjects rode an instrumented stationary 10-speed geared bicycle mounted on a platform designed to provide rolling and inertial resistance for six pedal rate\/power output conditions for a minimum of 2 min for each ride. The pedalling rates were 60, 80 and 100 rev min-1 and the power outputs 100 and 235 W. All rides were presented in random order. The forces applied to the pedals, the pedal angle with respect to the crank and the crank angle were recorded for the final 30 s of each ride. From these data, a number of variables were computed including peak normal and tangential forces, crank torque, angular impulse, proportion of resultant force perpendicular to the crank, and pedal angle.

A coil end often includes a closely wound (or closed) turn so that the coil end provides a uniform contact surface. Grinding the end surface of a coil spring is also known as a means for providing a uniform contact surface. However, the entire contact surface of the closely wound turn and ground end may not contact an opposing member, such as a spring seat, but instead, they tend to contact the opposing member partially at unpredictable points, which can result in a varying spring property or varying relationship between the load and the compression stroke. Also the closely wound turn and ground end are not effective in producing the spring force. Therefore, in applications where the length of the coil spring is desired to be minimized while providing a maximum spring action, an open end coil spring is sometimes used. The last coil at either end of such a coil spring may be an open or closed turn, and may, or may not be, ground. Such a coil may be referred to as the \u201cend turn\u201d.

However, it is not known if these in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells have the capacity to migrate in vivo, especially to T cell areas of lymphoid tissue. We have used a fluorescent marker system to track the migration of dendritic cells, propagated in vitro from chimpanzee peripheral blood, following SC injection. We report that injected dendritic cells migrate spontaneously and rapidly to draining lymph nodes where they remain for at least five days. The injected cells interdigitate with T cells in the parafollicular and paracortical zones and retain high level expression of CD86, CD40 and MHC Class II molecules, reflecting a phenotype of potent APC. We conclude that dendritic cells differentiated in vitro from peripheral blo od and administered subcutaneously behave in a manner very similar to endogenous Langerhans cells. These data provide strong experimental support, in a highly relevant large animal model, for the use of in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells as vehicles for immunotherapy. More importantly, they show that the SC route of injection delivers these antigen-presenting cells to sites of T cell activation, a prerequisite for the generation of an effective immune response.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE from the text chunk you have read.

Analysis of tumor development in a backcross of (FVBB6 Apc(Min\/+)) x B6 Apc(Min\/+) mice has identified a modifier on chromosome 9 that significantly affects tumor multiplicity, and a modifier on chromosome 4 that significantly affects tumor latency and affects tumor number with suggestive significance. This modifier was also identified in a backcross involving 129X1\/SvJ and B6 Apc(Min\/+) mice. A modifier on chromosome 18 specifically affects tumor latency but not tumor number. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggests there is at least an additive interaction affecting tumor latency between the loci on chromosomes 4 and 18. We also identified a modifier locus on chromosome 6 that interacts with the loci on chromosome 4 and chromosome 9 to affect tumor number.

To describe the usage of emergency medical services (EMS) by children with special health care needs (CSHCN). All EMS runs and related hospital records for children aged 0-17 years in Utah in 1991-92 were linked. The CSHCN status was determined from ICD-9 diagnoses using three available definitions. The amounts of EMS usage were compared between CSHCN and other children. A pediatric intensive care practitioner determined CSHCN status by chart review for 915 children transported by EMS to a pediatric tertiary care hospital, and his classification was compared with the CSHCN status assigned by the three ICD-9-based definitions. The three definitions assigned CSHCN status for 2% to 24% of children using EMS. When compared with other children, CSHCN were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, more likely to use EMS for transfer between health care facilities, and more likely to receive prehospital procedures such as intravenous therapy. In the group of children whose charts were reviewed individually, one ICD-9-based definition most closely agreed to determination of CSHCN status by a pediatric intensive care practitioner. Children with special health care needs who use EMS are more likely to receive advanced life support service, to receive prehospital procedures, and to be transferred from one health care facility to another.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type VIRUS from the text chunk you have read.

To compare lipid profile in lean and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome with normal weight and obese controls. The case-control study was conducted at the Department of Chemical Pathology, Liaquat National Hospital, Karachi, from March 2006 to April 2007. It comprised 50 cases of polycystic ovary syndrome along with 50 healthy controls matching for age, gender and weight. SPSS 14 was used for statistical analysis. The mean fasting levels of triglyceride and Low density lipoprotein cholesterol were considerably higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome than those in the control group (p < 0.05), while high-density lipoprotein cholesterolwas significantly low in patients than the controls (p <0.001). Obese patients had high triglyceride value (p < 0.05). There was significant interaction between polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity and triglyceride levels (p < 0.05). Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with a more pronounced atherogenic lipid profile. Lipid parameters were adversely affected in a subgroup that was obese. As such, women with polycystic ovary syndrome are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease due to the presence of dyslipidaemia.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type MEDICAL FACILITY from the text chunk you have read.

In order to better rehabilitate lower limb amputees, prosthetic technology needs to facilitate turning gait by providing torsional control in the transverse plane. This paper characterizes biological ankle function in the transverse plane during turning gait with simple mechanical elements to assist in the design of a biomimetic prosthetic ankle joint. Motion capture data was collected from ten subjects performing left and right turns through a 90 degrees hallway corner. The Initiation, Apex, and Termination steps of the turn were investigated. The data for each step was separated into several states, and passive elements were chosen to model the ankle in each state. During the first state of each turning step, the ankle behaved similarly to straight steps by limiting the kinetic energy of the foot prior to foot flat. During the subsequent states of each turning step, the ankle altered its characteristic properties to accommodate the curved trajectory of the body center of mass. The results suggest controlling transverse plane stiffness with a finite state control system will suffice to mimic biological function during a turn.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type PEOPLE from the text chunk you have read.

Recent studies have demonstrated increased resting-state cortico-cortical functional connectivity in untreated Parkinson's disease (PD). We set out to determine whether this connectivity can be modulated by dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) and explore the relationship of therapy-induced changes in connectivity with motor improvement in the relatively early stages of DRT in PD. Whole-head magnetoencephalography was performed in an eyes-closed resting-state condition in 37 patients with levodopa-treated PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3) both in a practically defined \"OFF\" and in the \"ON\" medication state. Data analysis involved calculation of three synchronisation likelihood (SL; a general measure of linear and non-linear temporal correlations between time series) measures which reflect functional coupling within and between ten major cortical areas in five frequency bands. The transition from the \"OFF\" to the \"ON\" state led to increases of SL in the 4-30 Hz range, most conspicuously with regard to local SL, in tandem with motor improvement. We found a negative correlation between the change in local beta SL and the reduction of parkinsonism after DRT. Patients presenting with relatively large motor responses (41% or better) actually showed decreases in local beta SL.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ANATOMY from the text chunk you have read.

How are conservative smart growthers (or CSGs) similar to their more liberal allies? Like environmentally minded critics of sprawl, CSGs oppose government subsidies for sprawl and sprawl-generating government regulations. In particular, quite a few of the new blog's posts focus on wasteful sprawl-generating road spending. Having said that, CSGs do tend to differ from other smart growth supporters in a couple of ways. First, they tend to be fiscal conservatives, and thus skeptical of public amenities that are nice to have but perhaps not absolute necessities. As a result, they are less consistently supportive of public spending on public transit and pedestrian\/bicycle facilities than liberals might be. Second, some issues that are generally part of today's liberal agenda are deemphasized by CSGs. In particular, CSGs are less likely to discuss climate change or social diversity than liberal new urbanists. I also suspect that CSGs are less likely to support smart growth regulations such as Oregon's growth boundaries; but since most Americans don't live in Oregon, CSGs aren't as obsessed with these regulations as are conventional pro-sprawl conservatives.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type GROUP from the text chunk you have read.

In gel electrophoresis, the molecules are separated into bands according to the rate at which an imposed electric field causes them to migrate through a filtering gel. The basic apparatus used in this technique consists of a gel enclosed in a glass tube, sandwiched as a slab between glass or plastic plates, or poured in a plastic tray. The gel has an open molecular network structure, defining pores which are saturated with an electrically conductive buffered solution. These pores through the gel are large enough to admit passage of the migrating macromolecules.

History\n\nThe treasure of the church of Saint Servatius was put together over many centuries. One of the oldest pieces (today non-existent) was a reliquary in the shape of a triumphal arch, donated by Einhard (biographer of Charlemagne and abbot of Saint Servatius) in the 9th century. In the 11th century a custodian ('custos') was put in charge of the church's already seizable treasure. During the late Middle Ages the number of relics further increased. A septennial Pilgrimage of the Relics (Dutch: Heiligdomsvaart) attracted tens of thousands of pilgrims. At these occasions, the main relics were shown to the pilgrims gathered in Vrijthof square from the dwarf gallery. In 1579, the church treasure suffered badly during the Sack of Maastricht by the Spanish troops led by the Duke of Parma. In 1634, under the threat of war, the treasure was brought to Li\u00e8ge, where it remained for twenty years. After the conquest of Maastricht by the French in 1794, the chapter of Saint Servatius was made to pay heavy war taxes. In order to pay these taxes gold and silver artefacts from the church treasure were melted down or sold.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type DISEASE from the text chunk you have read.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered the case Tuesday of Joseph Cunningham, one of thousands of inmates who had to undergo the strip searches after every kitchen duty shift at the jail in Northeast Portland. The inmates were required to expose and manipulate their genitals and bend and squat in the presence of at least nine other inmates. Cunningham, in custody at Inverness from September to October 2011, complained that the searches violated his civil rights and were even more humiliating because they were done in the presence of other inmates with no privacy. As a result, the county began requiring dividers in November 2011 to afford some privacy. A curtain is drawn over the windows of the room where searches are done. They're visual-only inspections, with no physical contact and last less than a minute, according to the county. But Cunningham and others argue that the searches remain unconstitutional and represent an \"exaggerated response to security interests.''

Due to their unique ferroelectric and semiconductor properties, researchers are investigating the photovoltaic and photocatalytic properties of perovskite materials. Nanoscaled perovskite materials exhibit improved properties over bulk materials, and their unique characteristics are under investigation. However, using conventional methods to synthesize perovskite nanomaterials of small size and high crystallinity is difficult, and preparing them with different morphologies under environmentally friendly conditions presents an even greater challenge. Single crystal strontium titanate is well-known photocatalyst for producing hydrogen without applying bias since it has high conduction band and chemical stability. However, the band gap of strontium titanate is in UV region similar to most perovskite materials and limits its application. Therefore, it is very important to develop a technique to fabricate the strontium titanate nanowires with visible light absorption.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type APPLICATION from the text chunk you have read.

In many studies, the association of longitudinal measurements of a continuous response and a binary outcome are often of interest. A convenient framework for this type of problems is the joint model, which is formulated to investigate the association between a binary outcome and features of longitudinal measurements through a common set of latent random effects. The joint model, which is the focus of this article, is a logistic regression model with covariates defined as the individual-specific random effects in a non-linear mixed-effects model (NLMEM) for the longitudinal measurements. We discuss different estimation procedures, which include two-stage, best linear unbiased predictors, and various numerical integration techniques. The proposed methods are illustrated using a real data set where the objective is to study the association between longitudinal hormone levels and the pregnancy outcome in a group of young women.

With improvement in the performance of portable equipment, the capacity of the lithium ion battery tends to increase further, and thus securing safety has become important. In a conventional lithium ion battery, a polyolefin-based porous film having a thickness of about 20 to 30 \u03bcm, for example, is used as a separator to be interposed between a positive electrode and a negative electrode. As the material for the separator, polyethylene having a low melting point sometimes is used for securing a so-called shutdown effect, namely, melting a resin forming the separator at or below a thermal runaway temperature of the battery so as to close the pores, thereby increasing the internal resistance of the battery and improving the safety of the battery at the time of short circuit or the like. As the above-described separator, for example, a uniaxially-stretched or biaxially-stretched film is used in order to increase porosity and improve strength.

The Taxpayer in this case, provides capital for customers that wish to purchase new and used business equipment. Generally, the Taxpayer will enter into an operating lease with those customers and then it will assign that lease to a third party. In 2010, the Comptroller audited the Taxpayer for sales and use tax and determined that the Taxpayer failed to accelerate and collect the sales tax that was due at the time the lease was assigned as required by 34 Texas Administrative Code Section 3.294(h). As a result, the Comptroller issued a Texas Notification of Audit Results that consisted of unpaid taxes, penalties, and accrued interest. The Taxpayer filed an appeal and conceded that Rule 3.294(h) applied to these circumstances. The Taxpayer also agreed that when it assigned its right to receive lease payments to the third party it should have reported the tax due on the remaining lease payments.

Research suggests that increases in gross domestic product (GDP) lead to increases in traffic deaths plausibly due to the increased road traffic induced by an expanding economy. However, there also seems to exist a long-term effect of economic growth that is manifested in improved traffic safety and reduced rates of traffic deaths. Previous studies focus on either the short-term, procyclical effect, or the long-term, protective effect. The aim of the present study is to estimate the short-term and long-term effects jointly in order to assess the net impact of GDP on traffic mortality. We extracted traffic death rates for the period 1960-2011 from the WHO Mortality Database for 18 OECD countries. Data on GDP\/capita were obtained from the Maddison Project. We performed error correction modelling to estimate the short-term and long-term effects of GDP on the traffic death rates. The estimates from the error correction modelling for the entire study period suggested that a one-unit increase (US$1000) in GDP\/capita yields an instantaneous short-term increase in the traffic death rate by 0.58 (p<0.001), and a long-term decrease equal to -1.59 (p<0.001).","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type TRANSPORTATION from the text chunk you have read.

Description of the Related Art\nGaN has a large forbidden bandgap of 3.4 eV and is a direct-transition type of compound semiconductor, and thus has been attractive as a blue-light emitting device material. A material for a substrate in fabricating a light-emitting device using the GaN material is preferably a bulk crystal of the same material as an epitaxial layer to be grown, i.e., a bulk crystal of GaN. It is, however, difficult to form a bulk crystal of GaN due to a higher dissociation pressure of nitrogen; that is, it is very difficult to fabricate a GaN-bulk crystal substrate.

This study compares two methods of selecting inspiratory time (Ti) during mechanical ventilation. One selects a standard Ti producing a brief inspiratory pressure plateau (P). The other uses simultaneous pressure, flow and tidal volume (VT) waveforms, generated by a computer-assisted lung mechanics analyzer, to reduce Ti to the point where Vt ceases to accumulate and flow returns to zero. This method does not produce a pressure plateau (NP). Following saline lung washout, ten intubated, paralyzed surfactant-depleted cats were ventilated with pressure-preset infant ventilators at constant measured VT and rates. Five animals were initially ventilated with P (Ti = 0.98 +\/- 0.02 s) and five with NP (Ti = 0.77 +\/- 0.10 s). Ti was then varied to produce P or NP by using a four-period crossover design. All other ventilator variables remained constant. Intravascular pressures, thermodilution cardiac outputs, arterial and mixed venous blood gases and oxygen saturations, airway pressures, Ti, VT, and gas flows were measured; respiratory system mechanics, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients, and intrapulmonary shunts were determined for each study period.

Metabolic changes, including weight gain and onset of diabetes, have been associated with both systemic corticosteroid use and atypical antipsychotic drugs. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus in a Veterans Affairs population receiving antipsychotics and corticosteroids, using persons taking proton pump inhibitors as a control group. This study included data from subjects treated within Veterans Integrated Service Network 23 who had received an outpatient prescription in fiscal years (FY) 1999 or 2000 for a corticosteroid (CS), a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a typical antipsychotic, or an atypical antipsychotic. Patients receiving prescriptions in more than one class were not excluded. Subjects were excluded if they had a documented diagnosis of diabetes either in the previous FY year (1998) or prior to their index prescription date. Thirteen percent of the population had a new diagnosis for diabetes during the two-year study. Cox-regression analysis using time dependent covariates determined a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes (RR = 1.21) in users of CS relative to PPIs.

Each year, the number of human beings increases by 80 million, a figure which is equivalent to the present population of Germany. Thus, providing enough food, particularly sufficient protein for the increasing populace is a challenging task for societies all over the world. On a prospective basis, a progressively smaller proportion of human protein requirement can be provided by animal proteins such as meat, eggs, and milk. \"However, by feeding valuable plant protein to animals, almost two third of it is wasted as it is transformed into animal protein,\" Professor Dr Gerhard Jahreis, nutritionist at Friedrich Schiller University Jena (Germany), says. Rapeseed oil with its high nutritional value due to significant amounts of omega-3 fatty acids has gained a strong place in the human diet in recent years. Professor Jahreis comments: \"Annually, 60 million tons of rapeseed are harvested worldwide, corresponding to about 15 million tons of rapeseed protein which is fed only to animals.

Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is a benign tumor of placental trophoblastic cells, which release human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Several case reports have described complete hydatidiform moles with false-negative urine qualitative hCG tests. These negative pregnancy tests have been attributed to the hook effect. We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly < 100,000 mIU\/mL. The most common presentation of a hydatidiform mole is vaginal bleeding. Hydatidiform mole is associated with a risk of malignant transformation and disseminated disease. In a pregnant patient, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common presentations. Molar pregnancy is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding that should be considered. A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Urine qualitative hCG was negative and serum quantitative hCG was 1,094,950 mIU\/mL. Pelvic ultrasonography showed a uterine cavity containing a soft-tissue mass with multiple cystic lesions and the hydatidiform mole was extracted with suction curettage.

Traditional methods to avoid rejection involve use of immunosuppressive drugs that are not ideal for the health of the patient ([@R5]). The encapsulation of living cells in macroscale or microscale capsules provides a promising route for immunoisolation; the capsule's membrane protects the encapsulated cells from both the host's immune system and mechanical stresses, while allowing free diffusion of nutrients and metabolic waste to and from the encapsulated cells for their survival ([@R4]). Second, bioencapsulation technologies can be used for directed differentiation of stem cells for constructing different tissue types with high efficiency and specificity compared with 2D cell differentiation ([@R6]--[@R10]).

Fibroblasts suspended in a collagen matrix reorient the surrounding collagen fibers, resulting in a reduction in the size of the FPCL. The organization of collagen fibers by fibroblast-generated forces produces lattice contraction. An open wound in a rat begins to show contraction by 3 days, and its size will be reduced by 50% at 7 days. Fluid from 3- and 7-day-old rat wounds was examined for its ability to affect in vitro lattice contraction. Wound fluid was found to inhibit lattice contraction. The fractions which inhibit lattice contraction had molecular weights ranging between 10,000 and 20,000, as revealed by molecular sieve chromatography, and a high positive charge, as demonstrated by ion exchange chromatography. The factor(s) was only slightly affected by added indomethacin in the FPCL contraction model. This suggests a mechanism independent of the generation of prostaglandins.

For this reason they are attractive targets of immunotherapy regimes which aim to either attenuate the T cell responses to prevent allergic reactions, rejection of transplanted tissue and autoimmune disease, or augment responses against poorly immunogenic tumor or viral antigens. CD28 and ICOS provide costimulatory signals that allow a T cell to secrete effector cytokines but only CD28 costimulation protects a cell from apoptosis and permits long-term expansion. While much is known about the effects of the CD28 family on T cell activation, considerably less is understood about the signaling pathways that control these diverse functional outcomes. For instance, several groups have observed that CD28 costimulation enhances the expression of Bcl-xL and IL-2 using distinct mechanisms but the pathways that lead to this distinct regulation are unknown. Our approach is to utilize the structural similarity of the CD28 family to create a series of loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) mutant that will allow us to probe the mechanisms by which CD28 and ICOS alter T cell activation in primary human T cells.

After several years focusing predominantly on film and video, Koen Holtkamp began working with sound in 1997. He co-founded the Apestaartje collective\/label in 1998 while studying at The Art Institute of Chicago. The label released works by like-minded artists from Australia, Japan, Germany, Austria, France, and the US as well as several of his own works. Holtkamp has released two solo albums under the name Aero (Apestaartje) and four albums as Mountains (Apestaartje, Catsup Plate, Thrill Jockey), a duo project with Brendon Anderegg, as well as an album under his own name (Type). Gravity\/Bees marks his first solo release on Thrill Jockey. The main idea behind this recording was to combine the live and studio approach, older material with newer, as well as document Holtkamp's shift from digital processing on computers to the physical world of creating patches via modular analog electronics. Both \"In The Absence Of Gravity Please Note The Position Of The Sun\" and \"Loosely Based On Bees\" combine these elements and serve to document that transition. \"In The Absence Of Gravity\u2026\" is a side-long piece based around a 2008 solo performance in Brighton.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type FORMAT from the text chunk you have read.

However, it is not known if these in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells have the capacity to migrate in vivo, especially to T cell areas of lymphoid tissue. We have used a fluorescent marker system to track the migration of dendritic cells, propagated in vitro from chimpanzee peripheral blood, following SC injection. We report that injected dendritic cells migrate spontaneously and rapidly to draining lymph nodes where they remain for at least five days. The injected cells interdigitate with T cells in the parafollicular and paracortical zones and retain high level expression of CD86, CD40 and MHC Class II molecules, reflecting a phenotype of potent APC. We conclude that dendritic cells differentiated in vitro from peripheral blo od and administered subcutaneously behave in a manner very similar to endogenous Langerhans cells. These data provide strong experimental support, in a highly relevant large animal model, for the use of in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells as vehicles for immunotherapy. More importantly, they show that the SC route of injection delivers these antigen-presenting cells to sites of T cell activation, a prerequisite for the generation of an effective immune response.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type VILLAGE from the text chunk you have read.

The freezing of faeces is recommended as a means of avoiding such alterations, but this is costly under non-controlled environmental conditions. The present study was designed to determine whether the application of thymol reduced the proliferation of microorganisms in the faeces of Tamandua tetradactyla and whether it influenced faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) measurements.

The 2 and 7 day-old mouse hippocampal cultures were vulnerable to 5 and 10\u03bcM NP, whereas 12 day-old cultures responded only to the highest concentration of NP, thus suggesting an age-dependent action of the chemical on neuronal cells. The use of specific inhibitors did not support the involvement of calpains in NP-induced apoptosis, but indicated caspase-8- and caspase-9-dependent effects of NP. Specific ER antagonists MPP and PHTPP potentiated the NP-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release whereas, ER agonists PPT and DPN inhibited these effects. RXR antagonist HX531 diminished the NP-evoked loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the activity of caspase-3 and LDH release.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type BRAIN REGION from the text chunk you have read.

In the operative treatment of a long bone fracture, the most important point is to secure the bone healing and to strengthen the bone after removal of internal fixation materials. In this regards, the author has analyzed the mechanical strength of various internal fixation methods (a plate, a medullary nail, screws and encircling wires) on the bone by using acrylics models. Experimental studies of their influences on the bone have also been performed especially investigating the decrease in the bone strength in rabbits. All of internal fixation materials are made of 316L stainless steel. Recently, there has been a tendency to use larger materials for internal fixations such as an AO compression plate or a K\u00fcntscher type medullary nail. However, it was found that the rigid plate fixation greatly affects the bone strength. A medullary nail produced less impairment to the bone. But this method is restricted in its application because of the weak fixability of the torsional load. On the other hand, the internal fixations with screws or encircling wires are weaker than the other methods especially against the bending load. Therefore the commencement of postoperative treatment will be delayed. But, these two methods have little influence on the bone during fixation.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type EFFECT from the text chunk you have read.

The advent of expansion of treatment and care for AIDS in the region has provided important and lifesaving services, but has also added complexity to coordination and service delivery across prevention and care efforts. How to best combine intervention strategies (prevention, treatment, care, behavioral, biomedical) is a pressing question in the field. We believe that the best way to combine interventions is based on synergy, with intervention components directly reinforcing one another, not just whether programs occur simultaneously. In addition, needs are great and services limited. To achieve the maximum population-level reduction in HIV incidence it is important that those at greatest risk of transmitting and acquiring HIV receive more intensive interventions. We propose to conduct a prospective observational study of 1700 couples aged 18-45 years in Kisarawe, Tanzania who will be provided an intervention that offers: (1) HIV self-testing kits and pre-test counseling provided at the household, (2) linkage to a counseling and referral center for those who test positive, (3) facilitated enrollment to care and treatment for couples with confirmed HIV infection; and (4) access to pre-exposure prophylaxis for the negative partner in a HIV sero-discordant couple.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type INTEGER from the text chunk you have read.

History \nUp to the early 1990s, many programs and data transmission channels assumed that all characters would be represented as numbers between 0 and 127 (7 bits); for example, the ASCII standard used only 7 bits per character, avoiding an 8-bit representation in order to save on data transmission costs. On computers and data links using 8-bit bytes this left the top bit of each byte free for use as a parity, flag bit, or meta data control bit. 7-bit systems and data links are unable to handle more complex character codes which are commonplace in non-English-speaking countries with larger alphabets. Binary files cannot be transmitted through 7-bit data channels directly. To work around this, binary-to-text encodings have been devised which use only 7-bit ASCII characters. Some of these encodings are uuencoding, Ascii85, SREC, BinHex, kermit and MIME's Base64. EBCDIC-based systems cannot handle all characters used in UUencoded data.

Prosecutors want former gynaecologist Eduardo Vela, 85, to be jailed for 11 years for what they say is his part in the baby trafficking. Both sides have been summoned by the Madrid court trying the case on Monday from 11:00 am (0900 GMT), said a statement from the Madrid courts office. Vela, who worked at the now-defunct San Ramon clinic in Madrid, is accused of having taken Ines Madrigal in 1969 from her biological mother. Madrigal is now aged 49. The doctor allegedly then gave her to another woman who was unable to have children, who raised her and was falsely certified as her birth mother. During questioning, Vela said he could not remember details of how his clinic operated and said the signature on Madrigal's birth certificate was not his. A policeman who probed the case and was questioned during the trial says the clinic was a centre for baby trafficking. Vela is the first suspect to stand trial for the baby-stealing practice that began after Franco came to power following the 1936-39 civil war. Initially, newborns were taken from mothers opposed to the regime.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type FIELD OF STUDY from the text chunk you have read.

{"doc_question_pairID":"43448:6","tagName":"drug","input":"The pharmacology of dobutamine. Dobutamine is a sympathomimetic amine that was designed as an inotropic agent for use in congestive heart failure. Clinically, dobutamine increases cardiac output by selectively augmenting stroke volume, and this is associated with a decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance that is mediated, in part, by reflex withdrawal of sympathetic tone to the vasculature. This hemodynamic profile of dobutamine makes the drug of value in the management of low output cardiac failure. The inotropic activity of dobutamine has previously been attributed to selective stimulation of myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptors. However, recent studies from a number of laboratories indicate that the mechanism of action of dobutamine is substantially more complex. Dobutamine has the capacity to stimulate beta 1-, beta 2-, and alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the cardiovascular system at doses that approximate those used clinically. It has recently been suggested that the inotropic activity of dobutamine results from combined beta 1- and alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in the myocardium, and that this activity could explain, at least in part, the inotropic selectivity of the compound. Furthermore, in the vasculature, the beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatory effect of dobutamine is exactly offset by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor activity, such that net changes in blood pressure are minimal following the administration of dobutamine.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type DRUG from the text chunk you have read.

Although they optimize generic detection performance, such as mean average precision (mAP), they are not designed for *reliability*. For a reliable detection system, if a high confidence detection is made, we would want high certainty that the object has indeed been detected. To achieve this, we have developed a set of verification tests which a proposed detection must pass to be accepted. We develop a theoretical framework which proves that, under certain assumptions, our verification tests will not accept any false positives. Based on an approximation to this framework, we present a practical detection system that can verify, with *high precision*, whether each detection of a machine-learning based object detector is correct. We show that these tests can improve the overall accuracy of a base detector and that accepted examples are highly likely to be correct. This allows the detector to operate in a high precision regime and can thus be used for robotic perception systems as a reliable instance detection method.'","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type METHOD from the text chunk you have read.

The servo system uses servo data read from the disk surface to align the transducer with the desired track. The servo data is generally written to the disk using a servo track writer (STW).

The Rai and Binet staging systems are currently being challenged by the development of new biological methods to characterize the prognosis and management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To evaluate these two systems in recently diagnosed CLL patients, we performed a retrospective population-based study including 344 patients in western Sweden diagnosed between 1995 and 2000. Binet stage A patients had longer median overall survival (OS) (100 months) than stage B (55 months; P < 0.001) and C patients (45 months; P < 0.0005).

To determine biochemically the incipient timing of cerebral stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) the relation between the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in erythrocytes and the extent of stroke lesion was investigated. 2. When the blood pressure of SHRSP was maintained over 250 mmHg, the GSH-Px activity was lowered and the body weight also decreased. In the SHRSP where the GSH-Px activity in erythrocytes dropped below 23 units\/mL blood, the incidence of cerebral stroke was 98% (n = 88\/90). 3. The haemoglobin and haematocrit level were unchanged even after the GSH-Px activity dropped to 23 units\/mL blood. 4. Lowering of GSH-Px activity in erythrocytes observed during continued hypertension was found to be due to decreased GSH-Px protein, but not to an inactivation of enzymes, as evidenced from immunochemical titration. 5.

Citrus plants are natural hosts of several viroid species all belonging to the family Pospiviroidae. Previous attempts to detect viroids from field-grown species and cultivars yielded erratic results unless analyses were performed using Etrog citron a secondary bio-amplification host. To overcome the use of Etrog citron a number of RT-PCR approaches have been proposed with different degrees of success. Here we report the suitability of an easy to handle northern hybridization protocol for viroid detection of samples collected from field-grown citrus species and cultivars. The protocol involves: (i) Nucleic acid preparations from bark tissue samples collected from field-grown trees regardless of the growing season and storage conditions; (ii) Separation in 5% PAGE or 1% agarose, blotting to membrane and fixing; (iii) Hybridization with viroid-specific DIG-labelled probes and detection with anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and autoradiography with the CSPD substrate. The method has been tested with viroid-infected trees of sweet orange, lemon, mandarin, grapefruit, sour orange, Swingle citrumello, Tahiti lime and Mexican lime. This novel hybridization approach is extremely sensitive, easy to handle and shortens the time needed for reliable viroid indexing tests. The suitability of PCR generated DIG-labelled probes and the sensitivity achieved when the samples are separated and blotted from non-denaturing gels are discussed.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type PLANT from the text chunk you have read.

This process, colloquially known as \"the match,\" is completed using the Canadian Residency Matching Service (CaRMs), a national not-for-profit, fee-for-service organization (www.carms.ca). Students apply to individual residency programs across Canada through CaRMs, which then distributes the applications to the residency programs. Residency programs then review the applications and invite select candidates for interviews. Both the candidate and program submit rank lists based on their desired programs or candidates, respectively. This process culminates in match day: applicants log onto the CaRMS system to find out which city and specialty to which they have matched. The result is legally binding; thus, a candidate does not have the legal right to withdraw from the match or residency program. Each year, a number of Canadian medical students are unmatched in the first iteration of CaRMS. By not being able to secure a residency position in Canada, unmatched students face a future in which they will not be able to practice medicine.

Evidence is presented that the IL-2 induced CD23 expression and release of soluble CD23 (sCD23) are not mediated by IL-4. In comparison to IL-4, the IL-2-induced CD23 expression and sCD23 release revealed kinetic differences and were not inhibited by anti-IL-4. The prestimulation of PBL with Staphylococcus aureus strains Cowan 1 (SAC) led to a pronounced reduction in basal CD23 expression and to a change in the response of cytokines. Subsequent stimulation with IL-4 induced CD23 to the same extent as on unstimulated cells, whereas the IL-2-induced CD23 expression and sCD23 release were greatly reduced. Interferon gamma showed no effects on the IL-4-stimulated CD23 expression of SAC-PBL, whereas the IL-2-induced CD23 expression was suppressed.

Sagittally reconstructed 3D (SR3D) ultrasound imaging shows promise for improved needle localization for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (HDR-BT); however, needles must be manually segmented intraoperatively while the patient is anesthetized to create a treatment plan. The purpose of this article was to describe and validate an automatic needle segmentation algorithm designed for HDR-BT, specifically capable of simultaneously segmenting all needles in an HDR-BT implant using a single SR3D image with ~5 mm interneedle spacing. The segmentation algorithm involves regularized feature point classification and line trajectory identification based on the randomized 3D Hough transform modified to handle multiple straight needles in a single image simultaneously. Needle tips are identified based on peaks in the derivative of the signal intensity profile along the needle trajectory. For algorithm validation, 12 prostate cancer patients underwent HDR-BT during which SR3D images were acquired with all needles in place. Needles present in each of the 12 images were segmented manually, providing a gold standard for comparison, and using the algorithm. Tip errors were assessed in terms of the 3D Euclidean distance between needle tips, and trajectory error was assessed in terms of 2D distance in the axial plane and angular deviation between trajectories. In total, 190 needles were investigated.

One of the oldest pieces (today non-existent) was a reliquary in the shape of a triumphal arch, donated by Einhard (biographer of Charlemagne and abbot of Saint Servatius) in the 9th century. In the 11th century a custodian ('custos') was put in charge of the church's already seizable treasure. During the late Middle Ages the number of relics further increased. A septennial Pilgrimage of the Relics (Dutch: Heiligdomsvaart) attracted tens of thousands of pilgrims. At these occasions, the main relics were shown to the pilgrims gathered in Vrijthof square from the dwarf gallery. In 1579, the church treasure suffered badly during the Sack of Maastricht by the Spanish troops led by the Duke of Parma. In 1634, under the threat of war, the treasure was brought to Li\u00e8ge, where it remained for twenty years. After the conquest of Maastricht by the French in 1794, the chapter of Saint Servatius was made to pay heavy war taxes. In order to pay these taxes gold and silver artefacts from the church treasure were melted down or sold.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type METABOLITE from the text chunk you have read.

However, at the state of the art, no reports have analyzed the additional post-menopausal physiological mechanisms associated with the onset and development of bone complications in renal transplant recipients. We measured by means of molecular strategies (enzyme-linked immunoassay, chemiluminescence) the serum levels of Sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), two major antagonists of the Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway, and several bone resorption\/formation biomarkers (N-terminal procollagen type 1, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and serum C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen) in 19 post-menopausal kidney transplant patients and 12 post-menopausal chronic kidney disease patients (CKD group) matched for age and renal function. Our results showed that the levels of both Wnt antagonists were similar in the two study groups (P=.15 and .96, respectively).

The major surfactant protein SP-A is thought to play an important role in the regulation of the structure and the metabolism of pulmonary surfactant. We investigated whether this protein may be a target in ozone toxicity. Several properties were studied that are probably relevant to the physiological functions of SP-A. In vitro exposure of human and canine SP-A to ozone led to decreases in 1) self-association of SP-A, 2) SP-A-mediated lipid aggregation, and 3) binding of SP-A to immobilized mannose. SP-A was neither degraded nor cross-linked by ozone exposure. Exposure of canine SP-A to ozone led to an increase in the apparent molecular weight of monomeric SP-A. Human SP-A did not show this change. Oxidation of methionine and tryptophan residues in canine SP-A was detected following ozone exposure. Reactions of ozone with other amino acid residues were not observed. The impairments of structure and properties of SP-A may contribute to the toxic action of ozone in the lungs.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type AMINO ACID from the text chunk you have read.

Subterranean rodents inhabit closed tunnel systems that are hypoxic and hypercapnic and buffer aboveground ambient temperature. In contrast to other strictly subterranean rodents, Ctenomys talarum exhibits activity on the surface during foraging and dispersion and hence, is exposed also to the aboveground environment. In this context, this species is a valuable model to explore how the interplay between underground and aboveground use affects the relationship among basal metabolic rate (BMR), cold-induced maximum metabolic rate (MMR), shivering (ST), and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). In this work, we provide the first evidence of the presence of NST, including the expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and shivering thermogenesis in Ctenomys talarum, a species belonging to the most numerous subterranean genus, endemic to South America. Our results show no differences in BMR, cold-induced MMR, and NST between cold- (15 \u00b0C) and warm- (25 \u00b0C) acclimated individuals. Furthermore, thermal acclimation had no effect on the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in BAT. Only cytochrome c oxidase (COX) content and activity increased during cold acclimation. When interscapular BAT was removed, NST decreased more than 30%, whereas cold-induced MMR remained unchanged.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type TISSUE from the text chunk you have read.

The observance of the Feast of the Exaltation (probably from a Greek word meaning \"bringing to light\") of the Cross has been celebrated by Christians on September 14 ever since. In the Western Church, the feast came into prominence in the seventh century, apparently inspired by the recovery of a portion of the Cross, said to have been taken from Jerusalem the Persians, by the Roman emperor Heraclius in 629. Christians \"exalt\" the Cross of Christ as the instrument of our salvation.

Thyroid function was evaluated in patients affected by Fisher-Evans syndrome (FES) and compared to that of patients affected only by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and to that of patients affected only by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The study population consisted of 20 patients with FES, 44 with AIHA and 20 with ITP. All patients were examined for thyroid function abnormalities and thyroid autoantibodies. Abnormal thyroid function test results were observed in 40, 25 and 10% of the patients, respectively. The prevalence of antithyroid antibodies (ATA) in FES was 25%; this is higher than the sum of the prevalences of ATA in patients affected only by AIHA (11.4%) or only by ITP (none). Subclinical primary hypothyroidism and hyperthyroxinemia with or without hypertriiodothyroninemia, with TSH serum levels below normal, were present in 20% and 10% of patients affected by FES, respectively. Of the former, 75% were positive for ATA.

The scintillator effective luminescence efficiency, which may be defined in terms of the scintillator's X-ray luminescence efficiency and the scintillator-photodetector spectral matching and geometrical configuration, was studied for various X-ray imaging applications. Four scintillator materials Gd2O2S:Tb, Y2O2S:Tb, ZnSCdS:Ag and CsI:Na were used to prepare test screens. They were evaluated in relation to various photodetectors used in X-ray imaging, such as radiographic films, photocathodes, and photodiodes. Effective luminescence efficiency was determined for a range of X-ray tube voltages (50-140 kVp) by measuring the light flux emitted per unit of incident exposure rate and the spectra of the light emitted by the four scintillators. Scintillator-photodetector combinations resulting in higher image brightness level were determined for different X-ray imaging systems.

The effect of meal on blood glucose concentration is a key issue in diabetes mellitus because its estimation could be very useful in therapy decisions. In the case of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the therapy based on automatic insulin delivery requires a closed-loop control system to maintain euglycaemia even in the postprandial state. Thus, the mathematical modelling of glucose metabolism is relevant to predict the metabolic state of a patient. Moreover, the eating habits are characteristic of each person, so it is of interest that the mathematical models of meal intake allow to personalise the glycaemic state of the patient using therapy historical data, that is, daily measurements of glucose and records of carbohydrate intake and insulin supply. Thus, here, a model of glucose metabolism that includes the effects of meal is analysed in order to establish criteria for data-based personalisation. The analysis includes the sensitivity and identifiability of the parameters, and the parameter estimation problem was resolved via two algorithms: particle swarm optimisation and evonorm.

Factors that were studied regarding the RAPD performance were choice of primers and concentration of PCR reagents (template DNA, MgCl(2), primer and Taq DNA polymerase). A factorial design experiment was performed to identify the optimal concentrations of the PCR reagents. The experiment showed that the concentration of the PCR reagents tested significantly affected the number of distinct RAPD products. The RAPD protocol developed was evaluated regarding its discrimination ability using 70 different Yersinia strains. Cluster analysis of the RAPD patterns obtained revealed three main groups representing (i) Y. pseudotuberculosis, (ii) Y. enterocolitica and (iii) Y. kristensenii, Y. frederiksenii, Y. intermedia and Y. ruckeri. Within the Y. enterocolitica group, the European serovar (O:3) and the North American serovar (O:8) could be clearly separated from each other.

In order to better rehabilitate lower limb amputees, prosthetic technology needs to facilitate turning gait by providing torsional control in the transverse plane. This paper characterizes biological ankle function in the transverse plane during turning gait with simple mechanical elements to assist in the design of a biomimetic prosthetic ankle joint. Motion capture data was collected from ten subjects performing left and right turns through a 90 degrees hallway corner. The Initiation, Apex, and Termination steps of the turn were investigated. The data for each step was separated into several states, and passive elements were chosen to model the ankle in each state. During the first state of each turning step, the ankle behaved similarly to straight steps by limiting the kinetic energy of the foot prior to foot flat. During the subsequent states of each turning step, the ankle altered its characteristic properties to accommodate the curved trajectory of the body center of mass. The results suggest controlling transverse plane stiffness with a finite state control system will suffice to mimic biological function during a turn.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type PHYSICAL PROPERTY from the text chunk you have read.

It has previously been validated for an American population. We have translated the SMFA into Swedish and tested the translated version (SMFA-Swe) as regards validity, reliability and responsiveness. Acute and elective cases (n = 298) were included in the study. The Swedish version of the SF-36 was used in the validation. We found that the SMFA-Swe was easy to use, that its reliability (internal consistency and stability) was good, that it correlated well with the SF-36 physical scores and that it was also sensitive to changes in musculoskeletal function over time.

Discordance between effects of IL-1 and IFN-gamma. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is found on the surface of many hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cells and can function as an adhesive ligand for the integrin, leukocyte function associated molecule-1 (LFA-1, CD11a\/CD18). ICAM-1\/LFA-1 interaction is thought to be of importance in many immune mediated cell-cell adhesion reactions. Recently, the major human rhinovirus (HRV) receptor has been identified as ICAM-1. HRV has been shown to bind specifically to ICAM-1 on transfected COS cells and to purified ICAM-1, which has been adsorbed to plastic microtiter wells. We have compared the ability of ICAM-1 expressed on the surface of human fibroblasts (FB) to function as a receptor for HRV as well as a receptor for LFA-1-bearing human T lymphocytes. We show that FB stimulation by the cytokines IFN-gamma or IL-1, both known inducers of ICAM-1 synthesis and expression in FB, induced an increase in HRV binding to treated cells, which could be inhibited by antibody to ICAM-1. In contrast, only IFN-gamma and not IL-1 treatment of FB resulted in an increased adhesion of T lymphocytes.

In the past decade, high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have facilitated the identification of a diverse array of organisms that are rare in terms of biomass and could not be examined using previous molecular assays such as Sanger sequencing analysis of clone libraries ([@B31];[@B39]). Despite the fact that the latest NGS technologies enable reading only of relatively short sequence fragments (\\~500 bp), these so-called \"deep sequencing\" methods are still powerful tools that ultimately may enable researchers to obtain a more holistic understanding of microbial communities in their natural environments ([@B12]). Considering the current limitations of NGS technology, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences are better suited to downstream analytical methods such as fluorescence *in situ* hybridization. The original designs of most of the PCR primers used for the analysis of 16S rRNA genes were based on known sequences deposited in public databases. Researchers have since cautioned that these primer sequences contain mismatches with respect to environmental 16S rRNA genes ([@B5],[@B4];[@B35]), which may lead to considerable bias in interpreting results ([@B14]).","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type LIVING ORGANISM from the text chunk you have read.

Despite such requirement, insulated wires having an insulating layer prepared by the use of the aforementioned fluorocarbon resins are poor in flexibility and efficient installing of said wires in a narrow space within the miniaturized equipments is not attainable, also posing difficulty in workability when wiring.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type EQUIPMENT from the text chunk you have read.

Many psychostimulants alter plasmalemmal monoaminergic transporter function. Some, such as cocaine, prevent the reuptake of newly released dopamine, serotonin or norepinephrine into their associated neurons. Others, such as the amphetamines, facilitate release of these transmitters into the extraneuronal space by causing a reversal of function of these carrier proteins. An understanding of how psychostimulants regulate the function of not only plasmalemmal, but also vesicular monoamine transporter function is important to appreciate the pharmacological and sometimes neurotoxic consequences of administering these drugs, as well as the physiological regulation of these carrier proteins. Hence, this review will describe recent ex vivo studies investigating the rapid and differential affects of several stimulants on both plasmalemmal and vesicular monoamine transporter function.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type COMPETITION from the text chunk you have read.

Little is known, however, about its actions on neuronal cells during critical developmental periods. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic and toxic actions of NP on mouse embryonic neuronal cells and the possible interactions of NP with estrogen receptor (ER)- and retinoid X receptor (RXR)-mediated intracellular signaling. Treatment of mouse hippocampal neuronal cell cultures with NP (5 and 10\u03bcM) induced apoptotic and neurotoxic effects. The 2 and 7 day-old mouse hippocampal cultures were vulnerable to 5 and 10\u03bcM NP, whereas 12 day-old cultures responded only to the highest concentration of NP, thus suggesting an age-dependent action of the chemical on neuronal cells. The use of specific inhibitors did not support the involvement of calpains in NP-induced apoptosis, but indicated caspase-8- and caspase-9-dependent effects of NP. Specific ER antagonists MPP and PHTPP potentiated the NP-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release whereas, ER agonists PPT and DPN inhibited these effects.

In the embodiment of the dispenser shown in FIGS. 13-18 of the '262 patent, a braking force is applied to the roll by friction due to the weight of the roll. The axle, which supports the roll, sits in opposing tracks which are shaped so that the component of force which causes the friction increases as the roll is depleted. The object is to provide a braking force which, regardless of the size of the roll, is not so great as to prevent rotation of the roll in normal use yet will provide sufficient braking force when the roll is small to prevent free wheeling of the roll. In the illustrated embodiment, a separate friction roller is used to brake the roll when the roll is almost depleted. U.S. Pat.

Following the recommendations for statin therapy, we constructed an indication hierarchy with eight mutually exclusive levels of register markers of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Danish residents, as of January 1, 1996, were followed at the individual level in nationwide registers with respect to dispensed prescriptions of cardiovascular drugs and antidiabetics (1996-2005) along with discharge diagnoses and surgical procedures (1977-2005).

In past Covenant & Conversation essays on Acharei Mot, we have looked at the scapegoat as it figures in Jewish tradition and, in a very different way, in other cultures. But there are other dimensions of the rite that cry out for explanation. We argued that there were two goats because Yom Kippur represents a dual process of kappara, atonement, and tahara, purification, directed respectively at guilt and shame. But this does not explain why the two animals were required to be as similar as possible to one another, nor does it account for the role of casting lots (goralot). Presumably, these elements were designed to inspire feelings of awe and penitence on the part of the crowds that thronged the Temple on the holiest day of the year, but how and in what way?

Based on the viewing and analysis of approximately two dozen films, I have determined that Western filmmakers working between 193 9 and 2010 have chosen to depict Russian men and women in decidedly different ways. Representations of male Russian characters shifted significantly based on the state of foreign relations. In contrast, female Russian film characters changed little over time. In the interest of producing profitable entertainment, filmmakers developed this formula prior to the start of the Cold War and have continued to employ it. This gender dichotomy is representative of a melding of the belief in the superiority of Western society and patriarchal attitudes. This study documents the changes in depictions of Russian men while also describing the static portrayal of Russian women. Filmmakers are likely to adhere to their current methods of developing Russian characters as long as the films they make continue to be profitable.

The haptoglobin plasma concentrations in 110 fattening pigs living on three commercial farms and in 28 animals on the university pilot farm were measured using a nephelometric detection method based on an immunoassay. Following calibration of the automated analyser (Nephelometer BN 100) with a human haptoglobin standard, the measurements were performed using anti-human antiserum from rabbits. Differences in age, gender or breed of apparently healthy animals seem to have no influence on the plasma concentration of the protein. The average plasma level of haptoglobin in animals suffering from acute respiratory diseases was significantly higher. Furthermore, an increase was observed in animals without clinical symptoms living on a farm characterized by obvious defects in housing conditions. Comparison studies of the nephelometric method by use of a human or porcine standard for calibration and different anti-human or anti-porcine antisera with radial immunodiffusion as a reference method resulted in high correlation coefficients for all variations. Optimal accuracy was obtained by calibrating the analyser with a porcine standard. Haptoglobin determinations have been shown to be a useful tool for health monitoring during the integrated pig-production process, allowing recognition of performance-reducing conditions. The immunonephelometric determination method is suitable for quantifying porcine plasma haptoglobin for routine checks.

We also purified and characterized glucokinase and \u03b1-phosphoglucomutase, which catalyze early catabolic steps of the two carbohydrates. N. meningitidis catabolizes the two carbohydrates either via the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway or the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby forming glyceraldehyde-3-P and either pyruvate or fructose-6-P, respectively. We purified and characterized several key enzymes of the two pathways. The genes required for the transformation of glucose into gluconate-6-P and its further catabolism via the ED pathway are organized in two adjacent operons. N. meningitidis also contains genes encoding proteins which exhibit similarity to the gluconate transporter (NMV_2230) and gluconate kinase (NMV_2231) of Enterobacteriaceae and Firmicutes.

It was recognised that improvements were needed for the sake of the prosperity of the town and the export of iron ore from ironstone mines in the Brendon Hills to Newport and thence to Ebbw Vale for smelting. The Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500\u00a0ton vessels could enter the harbour. The west pier on which the lighthouse stands was constructed in 1860, at the same time as the current east pier, by Hennets of Bridgwater, and rebuilt in 1905.

These advantages make it possible to perform thermal imaging analysis of railway materials and\/or components, such as brake disc simulation, monitoring of abnormal heat generation, and monitoring of temperature changes, during mechanical tests. This study introduces the current state of research on railway materials and\/or components using IR thermography technology. An attempt was made to characterize the deterioration of electrical equipment of diesel electric locomotives using infrared thermal imaging techniques. In addition, surface temperature monitoring was performed during tensile testing of railway steels using a high-speed infrared camera. Damage evolution due to the hot spot generation of railway brake discs was successfully monitored using high-speed IR cameras.

The millimeter-wave band having a large bandwidth can satisfy this requirement. In addition, in a field other than communications, shock-absorbing vehicle radar as a new form to take advantage of characteristics of the millimeter-wave band has been introduced. It is greatly anticipated that the millimeter-wave radar can ensure safety in fog or snow. Conventional laser radar using light lacks this capability. When a conventional circuit structure composed almost exclusively of microstrip lines is used in a millimeter-wave band, loss increases due to reduction of Q. Furthermore, in a conventional type of widely used TE01xcex4 dielectric resonator, a large amount of resonant energy leaks out of the resonator. As a result, in the millimeter-wave band in which relative dimensions of a resonator and a circuit are small, undesirable coupling with the lines occurs, thereby creating difficulties in design and characteristic reproduction. In order to solve these problems, a millimeter-wave band module using PDIC(trademark) (Planer Dielectric Integrated Circuit) technology is mentioned.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type UNIT from the text chunk you have read.

{"doc_question_pairID":"41309:0","tagName":"organ","input":"Tracheal gas insufflation and related techniques to introduce gas flow into the trachea. Over the past 50 years, a variety of techniques have been developed that have in common the insufflation of gas into the central airway to facilitate carbon dioxide (CO2) clearance. These include continuous insufflation of oxygen, transtracheal jet ventilation, high frequency jet ventilation, transtracheal oxygen administration, intratracheal pulmonary ventilation, and tracheal gas insufflation (TGI). Continuous insufflation of oxygen is a technique used to enhance CO2 removal in the presence of apnea. Transtracheal jet ventilation and high frequency jet ventilation promote bulk gas flow into the lungs. Some techniques, such as transtracheal oxygen administration, provide insufflation of oxygen as an adjunct to spontaneous ventilation. However, other techniques, such as TGI, are used as an adjunct to positive pressure ventilation. Intratracheal pulmonary ventilation provides positive pressure ventilation while bypassing the upper airway. Although some of these techniques are promising adjuncts to mechanical ventilation and may help reduce ventilator-associated lung injury, much remains to be learned about their role in the care of patients with acute lung injury.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ORGAN from the text chunk you have read.

Leptin, the product of the obese (ob) gene, is mainly known for its regulatory role of energy balance by direct activation of hypothalamic receptors. Recently, its function in the acute control of food intake was additionally attributed to activation of the vagus nerve to regulate meal termination. Whether vagal afferent neurones are involved in longer term effects of leptin on food intake, however, remains undetermined. Using vagotomised (VGX) rats, we sought to clarify the contributions of vagal afferents in mediating the long-lasting effect of leptin on appetite suppression. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of leptin (3.5 mg\/kg) attenuated food intake at 4, 6, 8 and 24 h and body weight at 24 h postinjection in SHAM-operated rats; however, this response was not abrogated by vagotomy. In a separate study using immunohistochemistry, we observed leptin-induced Fos expression in the nucleus tractus solitarii, a brain structure where vagal afferent fibres terminate. This signal was not attenuated in VGX animals compared to the SHAM group. Moreover, leptin treatment led to a similar level of nuclear STAT3 translocation, a marker of leptin signalling, in the hypothalami of SHAM and VGX animals. In addition to the effects of leptin, vagotomy surgery itself resulted in a decrease of 24 h food intake.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ANATOMICAL ENTITY from the text chunk you have read.

The present invention relates to roller drive control methods of fixing apparatuses in electrophotographic image forming apparatuses. These image forming apparatuses are provided with fixing apparatuses that melt and firmly fix unfixed toner onto a recording paper. In this type of fixing apparatus, a thermal fixing roller system is often used in which, while the recording paper is sandwiched and transported in a pressing area (nip region) between a heat roller and a pressure roller, the recording paper is subjected to heat and pressure by the heat roller and the pressure roller so that toner on the recording paper is thermally melted and fixed there. In these thermal fixing roller system fixing apparatuses, the peripheral rotation velocity of the heat roller is generally controlled at a velocity of 1.005 to 1.03 times the print processing speed of the image forming apparatus. This velocity is a velocity for keeping the recording paper that enters the pressing area from being detained in the pressing area and is a velocity for eliminating the delay of nipping when the leading edge of the recording paper that is entering impacts against the pressing area.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ERROR from the text chunk you have read.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an essential enzyme in the catabolism of monoamines, and implicated in the immune response of vertebrates. In the present study, the full-length cDNA encoding monoamine oxidase (designated CfMAO) was cloned from Chlamys farreri by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches and expression sequence tag (EST) analysis. The open reading frame of CfMAO cDNA encoded 519 amino acids, which shared 73.9% similarity with that from oyster Crassostrea gigas, and 64.5-66.3% similarity with those from vertebrates. A conserved Amino_oxidase domain and a transmembrane domain were identified in the deduced CfMAO protein. The mRNA transcripts of CfMAO could be detected in all the tested tissues, including haemocytes, hepatopancreas, kidney, adductor muscle, mantle, gill and gonad. The mRNA expression of CfMAO was up-regulated significantly in haemocytes of scallops during 6-48 h after bacteria Vibrio anguillarum challenge, and it reached the peak (25.9-fold, P < 0.05) at 12h. The cDNA fragment encoding the mature peptide of CfMAO was expressed in the prokaryotic expression system, and 1mg of the recombinant protein (rCfMAO) could catalyze the deamination of 3665.59 nmol serotonin, 2061.89 nmol norepinephrine, 2104.85 nmol epinephrine or 3040.34 nmol dopamine within 1 min (nmol min\u207b\u00b9 mg\u207b\u00b9) in vitro.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type FILE NAME from the text chunk you have read.

Ototoxicity is one of the major causes of sensorineural deafness. However, it remains unclear whether sensorineural deafness is reversible after ototoxic withdrawal. Here, we report that the ribbon synapses between the inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion nerve (SGN) fibers can be restored after ototoxic trauma. This corresponds with hearing restoration after ototoxic withdrawal. In this study, adult mice were injected daily with a low dose of gentamicin for 14 consecutive days. Immunostaining for RIBEYE\/CtBP2 was used to estimate the number and size of synaptic ribbons in the cochlea. Hearing thresholds were assessed using auditory brainstem responses. Auditory temporal processing between IHCs and SGNs was evaluated by compound action potentials. We found automatic hearing restoration after ototoxicity withdrawal, which corresponded to the number and size recovery of synaptic ribbons, although both hearing and synaptic recovery were not complete. Thus, our study indicates that sensorineural deafness in mice can be reversible after ototoxic withdrawal due to an intrinsic repair of ribbon synapse in the cochlea.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type CAUSE from the text chunk you have read.

In particular, the introduction of the digital, terrestrial television according to the transmission standard DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting Terrestrial) is intended in the years 2003 and 2004. The objective of this transmission standard is primarily the achievement of a high picture quality in stationary, not mobile receivers. The high power consumption of the receiver associated therewith prevents a practical use of this transmission standard in mobile receivers. The standard DVB-H (Digital Radio Broadcasting-Handheld) was developed in order to enable a practical television reception even on mobile, portable receivers. This standard is characterized by a lower picture resolution as is sufficient for the generally relatively small display elements of mobile receivers and a lower transmission rate. However, a special characteristic of this transmission standard is a so-called time-slicing method, in which the transmission of the data takes place in sections limited in terms of time in the form of so-called data bursts. The transmitter can thus transmit, for example, several information channels in a time-division multiplex operation. A great advantage of this transmission standard is that extensive areas of the receiver can be switched off in the time spans between the incoming data bursts.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type AMINO ACID from the text chunk you have read.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to an ink jet type printer used for a recording apparatus such as a printer, a copier or facsimile to record characters and images. More particularly, the present invention relates to an ink jet head in which the deformation of a piezoelectric element is used for a drive source to drive an ink jet pump. Recently, printers are indispensable for attaining office automation. Moreover, printers are coming widely into private use. As a printer for private use, the ink jet type printer attracts the attention of users because, compared with a wire drive type printer in which printing is conducted on a sheet of paper by pressing a wire against a platen via an ink ribbon, the ink jet type printer in which an ink jet head is used is advantageous in that: it makes little noise; the printing speed is relatively high; and the printing cost per sheet of paper is low. 2.

Hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is a benign tumor of placental trophoblastic cells, which release human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Several case reports have described complete hydatidiform moles with false-negative urine qualitative hCG tests. These negative pregnancy tests have been attributed to the hook effect. We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly < 100,000 mIU\/mL. The most common presentation of a hydatidiform mole is vaginal bleeding. Hydatidiform mole is associated with a risk of malignant transformation and disseminated disease. In a pregnant patient, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are common presentations. Molar pregnancy is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding that should be considered. A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Urine qualitative hCG was negative and serum quantitative hCG was 1,094,950 mIU\/mL.

These 10 measurements were taken on different days within a period of 21 days. Additionally, immediately successive replicates were taken at the first visit when VC was used, allowing for the separation of technique repeatability from true day-to-day variation in TMH. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the mean TMH and 95% repeatability coefficients for repeated testing on separate occasions were: 0.25 to 0.29 mm, 0.14 mm--OCT, 0.30 to 0.36 mm, 0.13 mm--PACH, 0.27 to 0.34 mm, 0.092 mm--SL-F, 0.35 to 0.41 mm, 0.19 mm--SL-X, and 0.30 to 0.38 mm, 0.088 mm--VC.

Research suggests that increases in gross domestic product (GDP) lead to increases in traffic deaths plausibly due to the increased road traffic induced by an expanding economy. However, there also seems to exist a long-term effect of economic growth that is manifested in improved traffic safety and reduced rates of traffic deaths. Previous studies focus on either the short-term, procyclical effect, or the long-term, protective effect. The aim of the present study is to estimate the short-term and long-term effects jointly in order to assess the net impact of GDP on traffic mortality. We extracted traffic death rates for the period 1960-2011 from the WHO Mortality Database for 18 OECD countries. Data on GDP\/capita were obtained from the Maddison Project. We performed error correction modelling to estimate the short-term and long-term effects of GDP on the traffic death rates. The estimates from the error correction modelling for the entire study period suggested that a one-unit increase (US$1000) in GDP\/capita yields an instantaneous short-term increase in the traffic death rate by 0.58 (p<0.001), and a long-term decrease equal to -1.59 (p<0.001).","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type UI ELEMENT from the text chunk you have read.

The commonly described congenital atlanto-axial dislocation and Basilar-Invagination is antero-posterior or rotational or vertical plane. However, congenital dislocation in lateral plane has received scant attention. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe this unusual entity and discuss its management. The clinic-radiological feature of seven patients with congenital lateral angular AAD (CLAAAD) were studied and managed. The unilateral C1 facet had subluxed lateral to C2-3 complex. The C1 and C2 facets were drilled comprehensively and repositioned with distraction, placement of metallic spacers and facet manipulation after insertion of screws. The post operative outcome was studied. The presentation is usually with neck tilt (progressive in 3) and\/or progressive spastic quadriparesis. The mean C1-2 tilt was 25.2\u00b0. C1 was bifid in six patients. C1 lateral mass was assimilated with occipital condyle on dislocated side in and the other side was normal (6 patients). The dislocated C1-2 joint was abnormally oblique as compared to contralateral side. The relationship of occiput and C1 was normal. Correction of dislocation and lateral tilt was achieved in all patients with subsequent correction of neck tilt and deficits. One patient required reoperation.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type DOCUMENT from the text chunk you have read.

Radiofrequency (RF) and cryolesioning are established methods for the therapeutic interruption of sensory nerve supply to facet joints and other painful musculoskeletal structures.

Since there are 2 different physical methods for lesioning and a wide range of probes and lesion generators available, it is likely that the lesions generated by them may be of different size. We sought to devise an experimental setup that would allow for the reproducible and comparable evaluation of the size of cryo and RF lesions as they are being used in interventional pain therapy. A wide range of potential media was evaluated for this purpose. Based on technical specifications, as well as on preliminary testing, a specific agar agar gel with a gel point of between 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C and a melting point of between 80 degrees C and 85 degrees C was selected for these experiments.

The role of physicians, in particular those dealing with health promotion in the workplace, takes on a specific meaning in relation to the difficulties that disabled people encounter both in order to reach the workplace and to reconcile their working activity with the difficulties that result from their condition. Observing the data concerning employment of disabled persons in Italy, it becomes dramatically evident that among the disabled subjects of working age only 17% are employed. The objective of the occupational health physician is to recognise the impairment, study the disability and, possibly, eliminate or reduce the handicap. Achieving this target is difficult, and there is often a lack in understanding the discomforts experienced by disabled people in their working activity. Expression of a judgement of work fitness for a specific task is a particularly delicate matter, all the more so if the worker is a disabled person. A judgement of work fitness of a disabled person should include evaluation of the person's ability and an analysis of the working task and the workplace.

The advent of expansion of treatment and care for AIDS in the region has provided important and lifesaving services, but has also added complexity to coordination and service delivery across prevention and care efforts. How to best combine intervention strategies (prevention, treatment, care, behavioral, biomedical) is a pressing question in the field. We believe that the best way to combine interventions is based on synergy, with intervention components directly reinforcing one another, not just whether programs occur simultaneously. In addition, needs are great and services limited. To achieve the maximum population-level reduction in HIV incidence it is important that those at greatest risk of transmitting and acquiring HIV receive more intensive interventions. We propose to conduct a prospective observational study of 1700 couples aged 18-45 years in Kisarawe, Tanzania who will be provided an intervention that offers: (1) HIV self-testing kits and pre-test counseling provided at the household, (2) linkage to a counseling and referral center for those who test positive, (3) facilitated enrollment to care and treatment for couples with confirmed HIV infection; and (4) access to pre-exposure prophylaxis for the negative partner in a HIV sero-discordant couple.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type PROGRAMMING CONCEPT from the text chunk you have read.

High-speed fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) reconstruction for 3-D heterogeneous media is still one of the most challenging problems in diffusive optical fluorescence imaging. In this paper, we propose a fast FMT reconstruction method that is based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and accelerated by a cluster of graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on the Message Passing Interface standard, we modified the MC code for fast FMT reconstruction, and different Green's functions representing the flux distribution in media are calculated simultaneously by different GPUs in the cluster. A load-balancing method was also developed to increase the computational efficiency. By applying the Fr\u00e9chet derivative, a Jacobian matrix is formed to reconstruct the distribution of the fluorochromes using the calculated Green's functions. Phantom experiments have shown that only 10 min are required to get reconstruction results with a cluster of 6 GPUs, rather than 6 h with a cluster of multiple dual opteron CPU nodes. Because of the advantages of high accuracy and suitability for 3-D heterogeneity media with refractive-index-unmatched boundaries from the MC simulation, the GPU cluster-accelerated method provides a reliable approach to high-speed reconstruction for FMT imaging.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type STANDARD from the text chunk you have read.

Most of the cargo of 16,000 tons of Bunker C oil was lost into the icy waters. The spill was extensively studied and reported upon because more spills in icy waters are expected to occur as more oil is produced from wells in the Artic region. One report of the spill, delivered at the Fourth Annual Offshore Technology Conference held at Houston, TX on May 1-3, 1972, is Paper Number OTC 1522, The Behavior of Oil Spilled in a Cold Water Environment, by A. Y. McLean of Nova Scotia Technical College. The report concludes that, while spilling oil in ice waters is initially blessed by the capacity of the ice and coldness to confine the spill to a smaller geographical area, the problem of recovery of oil from oil-water-ice slurry is insoluble, the removal of oil trapped in ice is extremely difficult, and the problem of recovering oil from a mixture of oil and ice is virtually insurmountable. The report further concludes one must wait until the seasons progress and the weather warms and the ice melts before oil recovery is feasible. Of course, the thawing permits the spilled oil to spread, and the earlier effect of containment of the spill by ice is lost.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type SHIP from the text chunk you have read.

H.B. 93 began with good intentions. Georgia legislators saw a need to protect privacy by regulating how law enforcement agencies use automated license plate reader (ALPR) technology and limiting how long police can store location data collected on everyday drivers. Unfortunately, the version of the bill currently on the fast track to passage is rife with problems that would not only harm the public, but threaten security research and hinder law enforcement\u2019s ability to ensure the integrity of ALPR systems. It could be voted upon by the Georgia Senate on Thursday, the last day for the legislature to pass bills. At the beginning of the year, the City of Kyle, Texas, approved a controversial agreement to install automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology in its police vehicles. The devices would come at no cost to the city\u2019s budget; instead, police would also be outfitted with credit card readers and use ALPR to catch drivers with outstanding court fees, also known as capias warrants.

It is an essential instrument in most tango ensembles from the traditional orquesta t\u00edpica of the 1910s onwards. As with other members of the concertina family, the bandoneon is held between both hands, and by  pulling and pushing actions force air through bellows and then routing air through particular reeds as  by pressing the instrument's buttons. Bandoneons have a different sound from accordions, because bandoneons do not usually have register switches that are common on accordions. Nevertheless, the tone of the bandoneon can be changed a great deal using varied bellows pressure and overblowing, thus creating potential for expressive playing and diverse timbres. History\nThe Bandonion, so named by the German instrument dealer Heinrich Band (1821\u20131860), was originally intended as an instrument for religious and popular music of the day, in contrast to its predecessor, German concertina (), which had predominantly been used in folk music.

For this reason they are attractive targets of immunotherapy regimes which aim to either attenuate the T cell responses to prevent allergic reactions, rejection of transplanted tissue and autoimmune disease, or augment responses against poorly immunogenic tumor or viral antigens. CD28 and ICOS provide costimulatory signals that allow a T cell to secrete effector cytokines but only CD28 costimulation protects a cell from apoptosis and permits long-term expansion. While much is known about the effects of the CD28 family on T cell activation, considerably less is understood about the signaling pathways that control these diverse functional outcomes. For instance, several groups have observed that CD28 costimulation enhances the expression of Bcl-xL and IL-2 using distinct mechanisms but the pathways that lead to this distinct regulation are unknown. Our approach is to utilize the structural similarity of the CD28 family to create a series of loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) mutant that will allow us to probe the mechanisms by which CD28 and ICOS alter T cell activation in primary human T cells. In Specific Aim 1 we will define the motifs responsible for the enhanced regulation of Bcl-xL and IL-2 and use these LOF and GOF mutants to characterize these distinct CD28 mediated signals.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type SIGNAL from the text chunk you have read.

The usual assumption of a Poisson model for the number of chromosome aberrations in controlled calibration experiments implies variance equal to the mean. However, it is known that chromosome aberration data from experiments involving high linear energy transfer radiations can be overdispersed, i.e. the variance is greater than the mean. Present methods for dealing with overdispersed chromosome data rely on frequentist statistical techniques. In this paper. the problem of overdispersion is considered from a Bayesian standpoint. The Bayes Factor is used to compare Poisson and negative binomial models for two previously published calibration data sets describing the induction of dicentric chromosome aberrations by high doses of neutrons. Posterior densities for the model parameters, which characterise dose response and overdispersion are calculated and graphed. Calibrative densities are derived for unknown neutron doses from hypothetical radiation accident data to deterimine the impact of different model assumptions on dose estimates. The main conclusion is that an initial assumption of a negative binomial model is the conservative approach to chromosome dosimetry for high LET radiations.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type MODEL from the text chunk you have read.

The prevalence of severe obesity (BMI e 35 kg\/m2) is increasing more rapidly than general obesity trends, and is estimated to affect 6% of the population. This degree of obesity is a particularly significant health problem due to higher rates of metabolic co-morbidities. Gastric bypass surgery is the only effective means to achieve a meaningful and sustained weight loss and improve co-morbidities in people with a BMI e 35 kg\/m2; however, this approach is not feasible to reverse global obesity rates. Work from our lab and others have described beneficial metabolic effects of gastric bypass that occur immediately after surgery and appear to be weight-loss independent. As a result, much attention has been placed on the gastrointestinal tract as a non-surgical therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic diseases. The intestines express numerous taste receptors that can sense the nutrient content of a meal and communicate this information to the body via hormonal and neuronal signals to control food intake, absorption, and metabolism. It has been shown that a high-fat diet can attenuate the ability of intestinal lipid to initiate neuroendocrine pathways tha promote satiety and reduce hepatic glucose production. Intestinal chemosensing is increasingly cited as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and metabolic diseases.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type COMPETITION from the text chunk you have read.

A short-term (72-96 hours) biocompatibility evaluation in vitro of four single phase dental metal alloys was conducted by determining cell proliferation rates correlated to the organization of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin in human fibroblast cultures. Immunocytochemical methods were performed to detect both cell proliferation rates by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and fibronectin arrangement, i.e., diffuse in the extracellular matrix, organized in fibrils or in focal adhesions. We showed that cell proliferation rates were related to fibronectin expression. In particular, a higher percentage of cells in the S-phase were related to a predominance of fibronectin organized both in fibrils and in focal adhesions. The alloy with the highest Au content seemed the most biocompatible among those tested, since it behaved in a very similar manner to the controls. On the contrary, fibroblasts exposed to the alloy with the highest percentage of Ag had the most different behavior as compared to the controls. We can assume that a correlation exists between fibronectin organization and the percentage of BrdU-positive cells and that these parameters are varying with the different metal composition of the alloys. The observation of fibronectin arrangement together with cell proliferation rates could be considered a useful tool to determine the biocompatibility of these biomaterials.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type LANGUAGE from the text chunk you have read.

The response from the rest of Europe, however, was even more startling. They did nothing. France shrunk from fear, Russia tried to cut a deal, and Italy joined forces. The Swedes and the Swiss said they were neutral. Neville Chamberlain, the prime minister of England, and his political friends followed a policy of appeasement. Basically, they ignored the threat, gave Hitler his way, and hoped against hope that \u201cwar\u201d would go away. It did not. Hitler grew in power and tyrannized most of Europe. Chamberlain resigned in shame. Britain stood alone against the Fascist regime. It was only when the resolve of Britain and America stood up to evil that any end to the war could come. Millions of men, women, and children lost their lives due to apathy. No one wanted another world war, but only war could stop a ruthless dictator.

{"doc_question_pairID":"42157:4","tagName":"outcome","input":"Members of the CD28 family (CD28 and ICOS) play key roles in regulating T cell activation in response to antigen. For this reason they are attractive targets of immunotherapy regimes which aim to either attenuate the T cell responses to prevent allergic reactions, rejection of transplanted tissue and autoimmune disease, or augment responses against poorly immunogenic tumor or viral antigens. CD28 and ICOS provide costimulatory signals that allow a T cell to secrete effector cytokines but only CD28 costimulation protects a cell from apoptosis and permits long-term expansion. While much is known about the effects of the CD28 family on T cell activation, considerably less is understood about the signaling pathways that control these diverse functional outcomes. For instance, several groups have observed that CD28 costimulation enhances the expression of Bcl-xL and IL-2 using distinct mechanisms but the pathways that lead to this distinct regulation are unknown. Our approach is to utilize the structural similarity of the CD28 family to create a series of loss of function (LOF) and gain of function (GOF) mutant that will allow us to probe the mechanisms by which CD28 and ICOS alter T cell activation in primary human T cells.

{"doc_question_pairID":"42415:1","tagName":"plant part","input":"A novel hybridization approach for detection of citrus viroids. Citrus plants are natural hosts of several viroid species all belonging to the family Pospiviroidae. Previous attempts to detect viroids from field-grown species and cultivars yielded erratic results unless analyses were performed using Etrog citron a secondary bio-amplification host. To overcome the use of Etrog citron a number of RT-PCR approaches have been proposed with different degrees of success. Here we report the suitability of an easy to handle northern hybridization protocol for viroid detection of samples collected from field-grown citrus species and cultivars. The protocol involves: (i) Nucleic acid preparations from bark tissue samples collected from field-grown trees regardless of the growing season and storage conditions; (ii) Separation in 5% PAGE or 1% agarose, blotting to membrane and fixing; (iii) Hybridization with viroid-specific DIG-labelled probes and detection with anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and autoradiography with the CSPD substrate. The method has been tested with viroid-infected trees of sweet orange, lemon, mandarin, grapefruit, sour orange, Swingle citrumello, Tahiti lime and Mexican lime. This novel hybridization approach is extremely sensitive, easy to handle and shortens the time needed for reliable viroid indexing tests.

A chemical spill, exposing hospital employees to 100% acetic acid, offered an opportunity to more convincingly establish the existence of RADS.

The transmission to the end consumer takes place mostly over terrestrial radio or cable links or based on satellites. In particular, the introduction of the digital, terrestrial television according to the transmission standard DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting Terrestrial) is intended in the years 2003 and 2004. The objective of this transmission standard is primarily the achievement of a high picture quality in stationary, not mobile receivers. The high power consumption of the receiver associated therewith prevents a practical use of this transmission standard in mobile receivers. The standard DVB-H (Digital Radio Broadcasting-Handheld) was developed in order to enable a practical television reception even on mobile, portable receivers. This standard is characterized by a lower picture resolution as is sufficient for the generally relatively small display elements of mobile receivers and a lower transmission rate. However, a special characteristic of this transmission standard is a so-called time-slicing method, in which the transmission of the data takes place in sections limited in terms of time in the form of so-called data bursts. The transmitter can thus transmit, for example, several information channels in a time-division multiplex operation. A great advantage of this transmission standard is that extensive areas of the receiver can be switched off in the time spans between the incoming data bursts.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type QUANTITY from the text chunk you have read.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to the field of text-to-speech processing and, more particularly, to disambiguating text that is to be converted to speech using configurable lexeme based rules. 2. Description of the Related Art\nOne significant challenge in automatically converting text-to-speech (TTS) is handling ambiguous text constructs. Ambiguity can come in many forms, such as abbreviations, acronyms, and homographs. Numerous techniques exist for handling such ambiguous text constructs, though each technique contains a variety of drawbacks. One conventional technique is to determine the part of speech of the text construct and to disambiguate it based upon this determination. While this is useful for ambiguous constructs that can be distinguished based on their part of speech, this technique cannot effectively handle constructs that do not have a common part of speech. Further, many text segments that are to be speech synthesized are not written in a grammatically precise manner, preventing an accurate determination of the part of speech. For example, text messages, conversational dialogues, and the like are often short, broken text segments, which do not perfectly conform to strict grammar rules. Another disambiguation technique is to determine a dialog context or topic type and to use the dialog context to prefer various possible interpretations over others. The different possible text constructs are selectively mapped to different dialog contexts to resolve ambiguities.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type MUSIC GROUP from the text chunk you have read.

In the end, however, the expedition signaled the end of serious collaboration between Arctic explorers and scientists for decades. Here\u2019s an excerpt from my Greely chapter in The Coldest Crucible: Arctic Exploration and American Culture. In June 1884, Commander Winfield Scott Schley cruised the waters of Smith Sound searching for Adolphus Greely and his missing party of American explorers. Greely had been in the Arctic for three years, establishing a scientific station at Lady Franklin Bay as a part of the International Polar Year. Two attempts to relieve Greely, in 1882 and 1883, had failed and Schley\u2019s expedition represented the last reasonable chance of finding the Greely party alive. When one of Schley\u2019s men discovered a note from Greely giving his location at Cape Sabine, Schley sent John Colwell and a small party to find him. Arriving at the site, Colwell found Greely along with six other emaciated men, survivors of the original party of twenty-five.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type URL from the text chunk you have read.

He co-founded the Apestaartje collective\/label in 1998 while studying at The Art Institute of Chicago. The label released works by like-minded artists from Australia, Japan, Germany, Austria, France, and the US as well as several of his own works.

Depression is an important cause of certified sickness absence in the UK. It is not known what factors are associated with variation in length of sickness certificates issued by the GP to the depressed patient. The purpose of the study was to identify patient, GP and practice factors associated with the issue of a long-term (> 4 week) fit note for depression. Sixty-eight UK general practices collected sickness certification data for 12 months. Over 35% of 8127 fit notes issued to 3361 patients for depression were classed as long-term (over four weeks in duration).

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to the field of text-to-speech processing and, more particularly, to disambiguating text that is to be converted to speech using configurable lexeme based rules. 2. Description of the Related Art\nOne significant challenge in automatically converting text-to-speech (TTS) is handling ambiguous text constructs. Ambiguity can come in many forms, such as abbreviations, acronyms, and homographs. Numerous techniques exist for handling such ambiguous text constructs, though each technique contains a variety of drawbacks. One conventional technique is to determine the part of speech of the text construct and to disambiguate it based upon this determination. While this is useful for ambiguous constructs that can be distinguished based on their part of speech, this technique cannot effectively handle constructs that do not have a common part of speech. Further, many text segments that are to be speech synthesized are not written in a grammatically precise manner, preventing an accurate determination of the part of speech. For example, text messages, conversational dialogues, and the like are often short, broken text segments, which do not perfectly conform to strict grammar rules. Another disambiguation technique is to determine a dialog context or topic type and to use the dialog context to prefer various possible interpretations over others. The different possible text constructs are selectively mapped to different dialog contexts to resolve ambiguities.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type PROGRAMMING CONCEPT from the text chunk you have read.

Test compounds included p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDD), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), permethrin, bifenthrin, tefluthrin, and chlorpyrifos.

Schistosomiasis is second only to malaria in prevalence and severity, and is still a major health problem in many tropical countries worldwide with about 200-300 million cases and with more than 800 million people at risk of infection. Based on these data, the World Health Organization recommends fostering research efforts for understanding at any level the mechanisms of the infection and then decreasing the social and economical impact of schistosomiasis. A key role is played by the parasite apical lipid membrane, which is entirely impervious to the surrounding elements of the immune system. We have previously demonstrated that the interaction between schistosomes and surrounding medium is governed by a parasite surface membrane sphingomyelin-based hydrogen barrier. In the present article, the elastic contribution to the total motion as a function of the exchanged wave-vector Q and the mean square displacement values for Schistosoma mansoni larvae and worms and Schistosomahaematobium worms have been evaluated by quasi elastic neutron scattering (QENS). The results point out that S. mansoni larvae show a smaller mean square displacement in comparison to S. mansoni and S. haematobium worms. These values increased by repeating the measurements after one day.

Stretching of the rectal muscular wall during a bowel movement, particularly during constipation, results in repeated stretching of the thin walls of the veins in the rectal area. This repeated stretching may weaken the veins, and result in permanent stretching and stressing of the veins to form hemorrhoids. Once hemorrhoidal conditions become established, the condition usually becomes more acute because the stool is forced through the rectal canal so that it pushes the already swollen veins outward, stretching them even more. The bulging veins may become prolapsed, descending below the anorectal line and outside the anal sphincter. The prolapsed veins may become thrombosed with blood clots and further distend the hemorrhoidal vein, to produce excrusiating pain and exquisite tenderness. Prolapsed hemorrhoids are quite painful and remain so until the prolapse is reduced. Bleeding frequently occurs with hemorrhoids. Depending on the severity of the hemorrhoidal condition, difficulty may be encountered in sitting and walking. Typical treatment of hemorrhoids is nonspecific, tending to deal only with the symptoms of pain, itching, bleeding and inflammation.

In order to define more precisely the protective epitope encoded within the first 25 amino acids (aa) of the E2 glycoprotein of the Trinidad donkey strain of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus, we examined the immunogenicity of smaller peptides within the first 19 aa. pep1-9 and pep3-10 elicited virus-reactive antibody, but failed to protect mice from virus challenge. Additionally, pep3-10 was identified by a competitive binding assay using overlapping peptide octamers as the putative binding site of the antipeptide monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1A2B-10. Since the E2 amino-terminal sequence for all VEE subtype viruses is conserved, we tested the protective capacity in mice of passively transferred mAb 1A2B-10 and found it to protect from both epizootic and enzootic VEE virus challenge. Since horses are an important natural host for VEE virus, pep1-19 was used to immunize horses and was found to be immunogenic and to elicit virus-reactive antibody.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type MEDICAL TREATMENT from the text chunk you have read.

Data is read from or written to a track of the disk using a transducer, which includes a read element and a write element, that is held close to the track while the disk spins about its center at a substantially constant angular velocity. To properly locate the transducer near the desired track during a read or write operation, a closed-loop servo system is generally implemented. The servo system uses servo data read from the disk surface to align the transducer with the desired track. The servo data is generally written to the disk using a servo track writer (STW).

In an ideal disk drive, the tracks of the disk are non-perturbed circles situated about the center of the disk.

It originally premiered in the United States on NBC on October 28, 2010 as a special Halloween-themed episode. In the episode, the Dean throws a Halloween themed party on campus. During the party, a few of the partygoers become sick from eating an unknown substance, that the Dean mistook for taco meat, bought in an army surplus store. The sickness causes those affected to turn into a violent, zombie-like state that can be passed on through bites. As the study group try to escape, the Dean (under orders from the army) locks the doors, trapping them inside with the infected. The episode was written by Karey Dornetto and directed by Anthony Hemingway, and also features the voice of George Takei. The episode's plot is a parody of various zombie and horror movies, with the infected students mimicking stereotypical zombies and various tropes of the genre being mocked. The episode received overwhelmingly positive reviews and was watched by 5.6 million viewers on its original airing.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type HOLIDAY from the text chunk you have read.

Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) are used extensively in a variety of applications such as antimicrobial agent, photo-catalyst and gas sensors. The expanding production and widespread utilization of CuO NPs may pose risks to individual organisms and ecosystem. Comprehensive understanding the CuO NPs-induced adverse effects and their underlying mechanism are of great importance to assess the environmental risk of CuO NPs and to expand their use safely. However, toxic effects of CuO NPs to individual organisms and the mechanism of their action are still deficient and ambiguities. To ensure the safely use of CuO NPs, more attention should be paid on the long-term and chronic effects of CuO NPs at low concentration. Efforts should be devoted to develop techniques to differentiate toxicities induced by CuO NPs or dissolved Cu2+, and to reduce the toxicity of CuO NPs by controlling the particle diameter, modifying surface characteristic, selecting proper exposure route and regulating the release of Cu2+ from CuO NPs.

The purpose of the study was to identify patient, GP and practice factors associated with the issue of a long-term (> 4 week) fit note for depression. Sixty-eight UK general practices collected sickness certification data for 12 months. Over 35% of 8127 fit notes issued to 3361 patients for depression were classed as long-term (over four weeks in duration). Having previous fit notes for depression, not having \"may be fit\" advice on the fit note, older patient age, the patient living in a deprived neighbourhood and a higher practice deprivation status were all significant predictors of a long-term fit note. Depression fit notes issued by female GPs to female patients were less likely to be long-term. Other GP factors were not significant predictors of a long-term depression note.

Although Rubisco is a large enzyme that has a molecular mass of approximately 550\u2009kDa, the maximum reaction rate at 25\u2009\u00b0C is only 15 to 30\u2009mol CO~2~ mol^\u22121^ Rubisco s^\u22121^\u2009^[@CR4]^.

Description of the Background Art\nBaseball caps and portable radios are well known and popular. Existing baseball caps comprise a bill and head cover. Portable radios known in the art include those adapted into headsets or sold under the trademark Walkman. Although awkward, oftentimes people simultaneously wear baseball caps and portable radios. This, however, can be uncomfortable and dangerous. Portable radios and headsets typically fit up against the ear or in the ear in a manner that drowns out ambient noise. Consequently, outside noises that would typically warn of potential danger go unnoticed, which can result in life threatening accidents. In addition, existing portable radio devices are not always adapted for convenient hands-free portability and use. Moreover, it is sometimes desirable to have an additional storage place for personal items, such as keys and money, and, or other accessories, such as a flashlight and, or sunshield, conveniently available.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type BODY PART from the text chunk you have read.

However, it is not known if these in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells have the capacity to migrate in vivo, especially to T cell areas of lymphoid tissue. We have used a fluorescent marker system to track the migration of dendritic cells, propagated in vitro from chimpanzee peripheral blood, following SC injection. We report that injected dendritic cells migrate spontaneously and rapidly to draining lymph nodes where they remain for at least five days. The injected cells interdigitate with T cells in the parafollicular and paracortical zones and retain high level expression of CD86, CD40 and MHC Class II molecules, reflecting a phenotype of potent APC. We conclude that dendritic cells differentiated in vitro from peripheral blo od and administered subcutaneously behave in a manner very similar to endogenous Langerhans cells. These data provide strong experimental support, in a highly relevant large animal model, for the use of in vitro-differentiated dendritic cells as vehicles for immunotherapy. More importantly, they show that the SC route of injection delivers these antigen-presenting cells to sites of T cell activation, a prerequisite for the generation of an effective immune response.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type TOOL from the text chunk you have read.

These functions were accomplished by the actions of multiple related ligands that activated a common transmembrane receptor protein. In higher organisms including mammals, the insulin and IGF ligands and their receptors diverged and assumed more circumscribed functions. The contemporary view is that IGFs serve dominant roles in cell proliferation, survival and organismal growth, whereas insulin's primaryfunctionsinclude the regulation of fuel accumulation, storage and energy expenditure. However, such a simplistic modeltends to obscure the fact that insulin and IGF-1 continue to perform overlapping roles in several physiological processes. During the last funding period, we used mice lacking either IGF-1 or insulin receptor in osteoblasts to begin to distinguish actions of IGF-1 and insulin in the skeleton. These studies led to our discovery of two previously unappreciated roles for insulin signaling in bone. First, insulin suppresses the Runx2 inhibitor Twist2, which promotes osteoblast differentiation necessary for normal bone formation.

Here are some stylish fashion tips to make sure you're saying the right thing! It has become fashionable for men to wear clothes that are very baggy, but this should be avoided. This makes you look sloppy and can make you look larger than you really are. While you do not have to wear anything that is too restricted, one size larger than your actual size should be the limit. The best fashion tip you can get is to be yourself when it comes to what to wear. People have different opinions about what is fashionable, and you may aspire to be something you're not. The truth is, no matter what your style, you are always in fashion when you remain true to yourself. Buy a variety of jewelry pieces. If you have a good number of colors and styles, you will always have something that matches your outfit.

Results In the larger cohort, among participants aged 40-49 at baseline, shift work without night shifts was associated with increased use of type-2 diabetes medication after adjustments for sex, occupational status, marital status, alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity [hazard ratio (HR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.62], while shift work with night shifts was associated with increased use of dyslipidemia medication after adjustments (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12-1.57).","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type MEDICATION from the text chunk you have read.

The breathtaking sights have brought more than 80,000 people to the observatory since it opened nine years ago. Dan Monk has worked as an astronomer at the observatory for four years and says they\u2019ve had their busiest summer yet. He said: \u201cWe used to have a drop in the summer when we had light nights and people had to come later, but this summer we\u2019ve had so many bookings. \u201cThe observatory is very popular which is down to word of mouth and more people are finding out about it. I love it. It is the best job in the world.\u201d\n\nWith the dark nights drawing in, here is what stargazers can look out for in the coming months.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE from the text chunk you have read.

Sharing of computational resources in the cloud system enables a provider to use these resources efficiently, while striving to provide adequate performance, which may be specified in service level agreements, to its clients.

We report an unusual presentation of a partial mole and review an alternative explanation for the negative hCG test. As partial moles are usually not associated with a large proliferation of trophoblastic cells, levels of hCG are commonly < 100,000 mIU\/mL.

We set out to determine whether this connectivity can be modulated by dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) and explore the relationship of therapy-induced changes in connectivity with motor improvement in the relatively early stages of DRT in PD. Whole-head magnetoencephalography was performed in an eyes-closed resting-state condition in 37 patients with levodopa-treated PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1-3) both in a practically defined \"OFF\" and in the \"ON\" medication state. Data analysis involved calculation of three synchronisation likelihood (SL; a general measure of linear and non-linear temporal correlations between time series) measures which reflect functional coupling within and between ten major cortical areas in five frequency bands. The transition from the \"OFF\" to the \"ON\" state led to increases of SL in the 4-30 Hz range, most conspicuously with regard to local SL, in tandem with motor improvement.

Using three different types of surfaces as exemplars, we report a gravimetric method as a viable tool for studying the de-pinning process. Namely, the de-pin time, tau(d) (the time required for a horizontal sessile droplet to de-pin at the triple phase line on a given substrate), is estimated without using a time consuming and expensive video imaging system. This is made possible by deciphering the non-linear portion of mass vs time data of an evaporating sessile droplet. Typical gravimetric glass-substrate evaporative mass loss vs time data has two regimes: a long, linear regime followed by a short, non-linear regime. Traditionally, researchers extract only the evaporation rate of a droplet from the linear regime but discard (by truncating the data) or ignore (thus deriving no information from) the non-linear regime. The origin of the linear to non-linear transition, found almost universally in gravimetric data, persists unremarked upon. By constructing three very different types of surfaces and comparing gravimetric data with video imaging data taken simultaneously, we report the transition is correlated to the onset of the de-pinning event in each case. This realization enables us to measure the de-pin time, tau(d), with gravimetric data only; i.e., without the video system, gathering more information from gravimetric data than previously considered.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ACTIVITY from the text chunk you have read.

We identified the genes encoding the proteins for the transport of glucose and maltose in Neisseria meningitidis strain 2C4-3. A mutant deleted for NMV_1892(glcP) no longer grew on glucose and deletion of NMV_0424(malY) prevented the utilization of maltose. We also purified and characterized glucokinase and \u03b1-phosphoglucomutase, which catalyze early catabolic steps of the two carbohydrates. N. meningitidis catabolizes the two carbohydrates either via the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway or the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby forming glyceraldehyde-3-P and either pyruvate or fructose-6-P, respectively. We purified and characterized several key enzymes of the two pathways. The genes required for the transformation of glucose into gluconate-6-P and its further catabolism via the ED pathway are organized in two adjacent operons. N. meningitidis also contains genes encoding proteins which exhibit similarity to the gluconate transporter (NMV_2230) and gluconate kinase (NMV_2231) of Enterobacteriaceae and Firmicutes. However, gluconate might not be the real substrate of NMV_2230 because N. meningitidis was not able to grow on gluconate as the sole carbon source.

After several years focusing predominantly on film and video, Koen Holtkamp began working with sound in 1997. He co-founded the Apestaartje collective\/label in 1998 while studying at The Art Institute of Chicago. The label released works by like-minded artists from Australia, Japan, Germany, Austria, France, and the US as well as several of his own works. Holtkamp has released two solo albums under the name Aero (Apestaartje) and four albums as Mountains (Apestaartje, Catsup Plate, Thrill Jockey), a duo project with Brendon Anderegg, as well as an album under his own name (Type). Gravity\/Bees marks his first solo release on Thrill Jockey. The main idea behind this recording was to combine the live and studio approach, older material with newer, as well as document Holtkamp's shift from digital processing on computers to the physical world of creating patches via modular analog electronics. Both \"In The Absence Of Gravity Please Note The Position Of The Sun\" and \"Loosely Based On Bees\" combine these elements and serve to document that transition. \"In The Absence Of Gravity\u2026\" is a side-long piece based around a 2008 solo performance in Brighton.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type FURNITURE from the text chunk you have read.

The complaint, dated March 21, says documents released by the attorney general's office through an Open Records Act lawsuit in Oklahoma seem to contradict Pruitt's sworn testimony and indicate Pruitt also used a personal email address to conduct official business. \"It appears that Mr. Pruitt misrepresented material facts that bore on the Senate committee's analysis of Mr. Pruitt's fitness to serve as EPA Administrator,\" the complaint states.

Total DNA from these samples was extracted, and M. immunogenum measured by qPCR by comparison with a standard curve derived from plasmid vectors. PCR counts were compared with bacterial culture counts. PCR counts of M. immunogenum varied from 1.42 x 10(3) to 3.68 x 10(6) cells\/mL of MWFs.

From 1812 to 1817 it was part of the municipality of Den Bommel, then it was a separate municipality until 1966 when it was merged with Middelharnis. Last one has made part of the new municipality of Goeree-Overflakkee since 2013. In 2001, the village of Stad aan 't Haringvliet had 1,068 inhabitants. The built-up area of the village was 0.23\u00a0km\u00b2, and contained 425 residences. The slightly larger statistical area \"Stad aan 't Haringvliet\" has a population of around 1,340. On 1 January 2009 the village had 1,399 inhabitants. Because of its location on the water, it is very suitable for aquatic sports. The street \"Voorstraat\" is painted by the Dutch painter Rien Poortvliet for his book Langs het tuinpad van mijn vaderen. This street also has the former town hall that ceased to be used as such in 1966 when the municipality Stad aan 't Haringvliet was merged. Other attractions are the Dutch Reformed church, the former doctors' house from 1876 and the windmill De Korenaar from 1746, which is still working.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type BUILDING from the text chunk you have read.

{"doc_question_pairID":"43468:6","tagName":"anatomical structure","input":"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nThe use of metal stents in the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most influential developments in the interventional endoscopy. The first clinical application of a metal stent in a non-vascular organ was on the tracheobronchial tree by Wallace et al. \\[[@b1-ce-2016-044]\\]. Metal stent technology has evolved rapidly over the past decade. Recent technological developments in interventional endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and metal stents have facilitated EUS-guided procedures using metal stents in various gastrointestinal conditions. Using linear-array echoendoscopes, a needle can be advanced into the biliary or pancreatic duct under real-time ultrasonographic guidance without the risk of injury to the intervening vessel. Because the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct are near the transducer of the EUS probe, both can be visualized without difficulty, and real-time puncture can be done easily, thus providing ductal drainage using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-based techniques \\[[@b2-ce-2016-044],[@b3-ce-2016-044]\\]. Over the past decades, the availability of the linear-array echoendoscope has led to the development of multiple EUS-related endoscopic techniques, such as pancreatic fluid collection (PFC) drainage, pancreaticogastrostomy, EUS-guided antegrade cholangiography and hepaticogastrostomy (HGS), and choledochogastrostomy \\[[@b4-ce-2016-044]\\].","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE from the text chunk you have read.

The two armies clashed near the town of Lutterberg, Lower Saxony. The 14,000 mostly Prussian Allied troops, were overwhelmed by several charges of French cavalry and were forced to withdraw. Despite having won a decisive victory, Soubise was slow to pursue the retreating enemy - causing his superiors in Paris to replace him with the Marquis de Contades. Soubise earned a Marshal's baton for this victory. Fran\u00e7ois de Chevert was decorated with the Grand Croix for his contributions in the battle. Bibliography\n Duffy, Christopher.

The organophosphate flame retardant, triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), has been detected with increasing frequency in environmental samples and its primary metabolite is considered to be diphenyl phosphate (DPHP). Information on the adverse effects of these compounds in avian species is limited. Here, we investigate the effects of TPHP and DPHP on cytotoxicity and mRNA expression, as well as in vitro metabolism of TPHP, by use of a chicken embryonic hepatocyte (CEH) screening assay. After 36 h of exposure, CEH cytotoxicity was observed following exposure to >10 \u03bcM TPHP (LC50 = 47 \u00b1 8 \u03bcM), whereas no significant cytotoxic effects were observed for DPHP concentrations up to 1000 \u03bcM. Using a custom chicken ToxChip polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, the number of genes altered by 10 \u03bcM DPHP (9 out of 27) was greater than that by 10 \u03bcM TPHP (4 out of 27). Importantly, 4 of 6 genes associated with lipid\/cholesterol metabolism were significantly dysregulated by DPHP, suggesting a potential pathway of importance for DPHP toxicity. Rapid degradation of TPHP was observed in CEH exposed to 10 \u03bcM, but the resulting concentration of DPHP accounted for only 17% of the initial TPHP dosing concentration.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type CELL LINE from the text chunk you have read.

Achieving objective and quantitative measurement of experimental pain in human volunteers and establishing the impact of drugs remains a difficult task. This problem may be overcome by employing a method which allows the simultaneous measurement of pain ratings elicited by standardized stimulation of the nasal mucosa by carbon dioxide, together with pain-related chemo-somatosensory evoked potentials (CSSEP) and vigilance. We assessed the effect of pentazocine and acetylsalicylic acid on these parameters in 14 human volunteers and related the effects to the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs measured at the same time. Pentazocine was found to reduce the pain ratings as well as the amplitudes of the pain-related evoked potentials and to increase their latencies. Vigilance (measured by EEG power spectra and performance of a tracking task) was also significantly reduced. These effects were observed during the distribution phase and the first period of the terminal elimination phase of the drug. Acetylsalicylic acid had no significant effects on pain ratings, but reduced the amplitudes of the event-related potentials when compared to placebo controls.

Methods Survey data from two cohorts of Finnish men (N=11 998) and women (N=49 944) working in multiple occupations where shift work was used were linked to national Drug Prescription Register data, with up to 11 years of follow-up. In each cohort, age-stratified Cox proportional hazard regression models were computed to examine any incident use of prescription medication for each of the three medical conditions, separately comparing each of two groups of rotating shift workers (those whose schedules included night shifts, and those whose schedules did not include night shifts) with day workers who worked in a similar range of occupations. Results In the larger cohort, among participants aged 40-49 at baseline, shift work without night shifts was associated with increased use of type-2 diabetes medication after adjustments for sex, occupational status, marital status, alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity [hazard ratio (HR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.62], while shift work with night shifts was associated with increased use of dyslipidemia medication after adjustments (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.12-1.57).","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type BEHAVIOR from the text chunk you have read.

If the cat has lots of corners to explore and interesting paths to take between them, most spaces that aren't claustrophobic for humans will be okay. If you're concerned, you can let the cat use more vertical space by setting up shelf systems or furniture to give them climbing paths; there are some systems marketed for the purpose but you could probably look at catalogs for those and figure out a homebrew version.

The patient reported by Skinner is similar to one whom we have been following at the Clinique Universitaire de Dermatologie in Geneva since 1978. After having reviewed the literature, we believe that KID syndrome is a useful, unifying clinical term.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type DISEASE from the text chunk you have read.

Description of the Related Art including information disclosed under 37 CFR .sctn..sctn.1.97-1.99. Universal remote controls are typically handheld devices capable of emitting infrared light modulated with information, which when received by equipment capable of processing such information, can control various functions of the equipment. A remote control is commonly called universal if it can send IR signals modulated by the codes pertaining to a wide variety of equipment, usually manufactured by different companies. Presently, universal remote controls are of two principal types: learning, wherein the user can \"teach\" the universal remote control functions emitted by an existing \"native\" remote control; and pre-programmed, wherein the universal remote control is manufactured with codes to control a variety of equipment already in its memory. One example of a learning remote control is disclosed in the Ehlers U.S. Pat. No. 4,626,848 and one example of a pre-programmed remote control is disclosed in the Rumbolt et al U.S. Pat.

Considerable effort has been spent evaluating aspects of low back injury risk in nursing yet comprehensive evaluation of all work tasks has been limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate peak and cumulative lumbar spine loads experienced by personal support workers. A total of 20 female long-term care workers were observed and had trunk posture monitored via an inclinometer throughout their shift. When adjusted for an 8-h workday, workers experienced cumulative loads of 21.3 +\/- 4.6 MNs, 1.8 +\/- 0.6 MNs and 2.9 +\/- 1.4 MNs for compression, lateral and anterior shear, respectively. Patient care, unloaded standing, walking and miscellaneous tasks accounted for almost 80% of cumulative compression, while lifts and transfers accounted for less than 10%. Mechanical lift assists reduced peak loads and contributed minimally to cumulative loading. These findings suggest that both peak and cumulative spine loads should be considered when evaluating injury risk in the nursing profession. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: This study has shown that tasks other than patient transfers and lifts are important in the assessment of low back injury risk in nurses. The method developed is a relatively straightforward approach that can be used to estimate peak and cumulative spine load to provide insight to risk of injury in many occupational settings.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type ENVIRONMENT from the text chunk you have read.

The distribution of nerve cell bodies and fibres in the canine stomach was investigated using antibodies to the general neuronal marker, neuron-specific enolase. Prominent ganglia containing many reactive nerve cells were found in the myenteric plexus of the gastric corpus and antrum. Nerve cells were absent from the submucosa of the corpus and were extremely rare in the antrum. Removal of areas of longitudinal muscle and myenteric plexus from the corpus (myectomy), with 7 days allowed for axon degeneration, resulted in the loss of fibres reactive for galanin, gastrin-releasing peptide, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide from both the circular muscle and mucosa in the area covered by the lesion. Combined vagotomy and sympathetic denervation did not significantly affect these fibres, but did cause fibres reactive for calcitonin gene-related peptide to degenerate. It is concluded that the myenteric plexus of the gastric corpus, like the myenteric plexus of the small intestine and colon, is the source of nerve fibres innervating the circular muscle, but, in contrast to other regions of the gastrointestinal tract, myenteric ganglia, not submucous ganglia, are the major, or sole, source of the intrinsic innervation of the mucosa.","instruction":"Extract the Named Entities of type GENE from the text chunk you have read.

Traditional methods to avoid rejection involve use of immunosuppressive drugs that are not ideal for the health of the patient ([@R5]). The encapsulation of living cells in macroscale or microscale capsules provides a promising route for immunoisolation; the capsule's membrane protects the encapsulated cells from both the host's immune system and mechanical stresses, while allowing free diffusion of nutrients and metabolic waste to and from the encapsulated cells for their survival ([@R4]). Second, bioencapsulation technologies can be used for directed differentiation of stem cells for constructing different tissue types with high efficiency and specificity compared with 2D cell differentiation ([@R6]--[@R10]).
